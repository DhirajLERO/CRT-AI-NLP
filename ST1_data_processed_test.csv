I know this could be my anxiety talking & i could be catastrophizing. But today on my way home from hosp i passed a speed camera van. I can't say i was doing 20mph because i can't remember but I'm not a speeder & I'm worried i could have been doing 21 - 22.
Unfortunately, it doesn't end there as there was another van neatly tucked away near where i live, that i didn't see until i passed it twice. Each time in a 20mph zone & again can't guarantee i wasn't doing 21 -22. 
We are only allowed 12 points & now I'm panicking & anxious I've notched up 12 points which will be a 6 mth ban & thinking,  how will i drive the 2 hrs to my nearest cf hosp? Pick up my meds? Get out for exercise as i live on a hill & my health & lf is low? 
I'm trying to stay calm but I'm so anxious & the weeks wait to see if fine (s) come through door is hard.
I wish my anxiety would quieten so i can see reason. 
Thanks for reading. I just needed to write it down to try & help me ease my mind.","Speeding fine

On the other hand - I can enjoy a burger, salmon, and beans with no trouble.  I will do an occasional steak with no problems either.  Ditto beer/wine.  Moderation being the key but its worth knowing that gout doesn't have to rule the menu -- if properly medicated.

9,sebhly,t5_2s23e,"In the process of being diagnosed. Already worried about telling family.
Okay, this might be a bit of a long one, and pretty personal. I know it's probably pretty hard to advise on something like this, but I'm supposing almost everyone here has had a similar experience. And maybe I just want to sound off and vent a little bit, too.

So, a week ago I didn't have a clue what MS was. I went to my doctor to discuss the results of an MRI I expected to come up normal, only to be told I have lesions that are more than likely MS (like, ""I can't tell you it's MS until you get the contrast MRI and the spinal tap, but it's probably MS""). I had no idea what I was dealing with, and my mind immediately started thinking about impending doom.

Thank god I found this subreddit. I now know that it's not a death sentence, that there's hope, and other people are living with this- you people are kicking arse and have filled me with so much courage and hope. I'm not scared anymore, I've had time over the past week to accept the possibility and get at peace with it. Maybe I'm being unrealistically positive and oversimplifying the issue, but I feel like whether I stay as I am now (minor symptoms that don't really impact my day to day life, just some fatigue, headaches, weird sensations, balance issues, and funky vision) forever or can't walk in the future, I'll be okay in the end. I'm almost inappropriately calm.

(sorry if that comes across as belittling people with more severe symptoms and effects, I don't mean it like that at all. I just feel kind of stupidly content not to worry in advance about my future and meet the challenges as they come, if that makes sense.)

I don't want to get ahead of myself before I'm officially diagnosed. But the one thing that is weighing on me horribly is the thought of telling my family. I don't want to say a word until I have the exact information from a neurologist so I can just lay the facts out for the people I choose to tell.

My grandparents my biggest concern. I guess this whole situation has made me realise what a tight knit family I have, and how fortunate I am. I'm close as hell with my grandparents and I know they'll probably worry themselves sick if they know about this. As much as I hope they live another fifty years, chances are that won't be the case, and given how mild and easily concealed my symptoms are right now, there's a good chance it won't be obvious for a number of years (I mean, here's hoping). This is kind of horrible to think about and I feel kind of shit for even writing it down but would it be kinder for me to let my grandparents live out the rest of their lives without having to worry about my health? I'm concerned that it wouldn't be possible to specifically keep it from them, and that even if I tried, they'd end up finding out by accident or from someone else, and potentially a garbled version of the facts rather than hearing it from my (very calm) mouth.

As for the rest the rest of my family, I wonder is it better to keep them in blissful ignorance until I can't anymore, or would that make it worse by giving them no time to get comfortable with the news before I'm physically changed? I live abroad, so I feel like they'd be insanely worried about me being so far away (and also the secret would be easier to keep) so maybe it would be better to hold off on it at least for now.

I get it, I'm overthinking before I even get properly diagnosed. And it's pretty typical of me to get lost in the moral specifics of choices I have to make. I know I can only do my best to do the right thing at the end of the day. I guess I'm just pouring out all of the thoughts swirling around my head on the matter, and wondering about all of your experiences on choosing who to tell and how to tell them.

Thank you to everyone who's ever shared their stories and experiences on here. You've made the past week a completely different experience for me than it would've otherwise been.","In the process of being diagnosed. Already worried about telling family.

I dont really know how to feel about all of this. I had my first seizure in July of this year. I say first because it was a full-on seizure where I dont remember anything happening. We were able to connect at least two other experiences in my past (5+ years ago) as possible seizures (mini seizures? I dont know a term for them) but I was fully aware during them. 

Anyway, my sleep-deprived EEG came back abnormal and my first neurologist started me right away on Briviact. My insurance refused to cover it, so they were going to switch me to Keppra. Then I ended up switching to a neurologist that specializes in epilepsy and he decided I would do better on lamotrigine so now I am weaning off the Briviact and going onto 300mg lamotrigine per day.

Basically, this all just feels so ridiculous to me but I suppose I am naive and dont know much about epilepsy. I dont even fully understand my own EEG report. I ask for timelines if they ever think I can come off the medication and they are not really giving me anything besides you need to be on medication. I just feel like this is all so blown out of proportion from basically one seizure. I am also someone who pretty much avoids medication at all costs, dont know why, but I have always been this way and the thought of taking daily medication for the foreseeable future is freaking me out.

I just feel like this is all so blown out of proportion from basically one seizure. I am also someone who pretty much avoids medication at all costs, dont know why, but I have always been this way and the thought of taking daily medication for the foreseeable future is freaking me out. I have read through this forum and see stuff like 10 days seizure free! and I really dont feel like I can relate. I had one confirmed episode and suddenly I have epilepsy? Please tell me I am not alone in feeling this way."

25,rsi32t,t5_2syer,"What tests should I ask my doctor for to confirm if this is gout or not
I have been sober for the past seven months.  I went my hunt camp in November and had 1/4 of a shot and two fingers or beer daily.  There was a lot of meat as you can imagine.  By the end of the trip my toe was swollen and I was generally in pain.  I came back went to my doc and said he thought it was gout.  Told me to take 500mg of Alieve twice a day if it reoccurs.  He also sent me for a uric acid test which was 6.8.  Fast forward one month and I haven introduced alcohol back into my life.  I am not drinking excessively but I am drinking.  Yesterday I had a bit more than usual having 1 bottle of wine and 2 tall boys.  I also ate oysters and made the most incredible octopus pasta known to man :) Anyway today I feel my toe again.  

I took an Advil and before I got to bed I will take 2 Alieve's.  I fairly confident this is gout but I have also had that toe pop a couple of days ago and some very mild pain of the toe for the last week or two.  It was so mild I don't even know when it started nor did bother me.  Anyhow what should ask my doctor to confirm whether this is gout for sure or not.  

The first time this happened my toe was pretty painful but not excruciating or anything like that, but maybe because I am on 7.5mg of Prednisone for life (Addison's disease).  Sheets and socks did not bother it but putting my shoe was somewhat difficult although not impossible.  I want to confirm this is gout 100% before I start on a regime of NSAIDs that I might not need.  The other thing that perplexes is that I am not overweight like I read on here.  I am 6'4"" 205lbs.  I probably should be 190 but that is not far off.  I also exercise like crazy.  This year alone I have done 5300KM on my bike.  Why the fuck is this happening to me.  I am so down about this its insane especially when I read the Dr Edwards AMA that gout is also associated with heart disease, high blood pressure and a poor immune system.  

So based on all of this how do I confirm for sure if this is gout. ","What tests should I ask my doctor for to confirm if this is gout or not

So, just saw my neuro properly and explained most of my symptoms since June to him. (unfortunately left some out, it's been a rough time and I should have wrote literally everything down, but I mailed him some stuff I forgot.)

He seemed unconcerned until he tested my reflexes, the most notable being... whatever he was testing by moving my fingers down. Along with my left leg not really giving the knee jerk or some other reaction he was looking for with my foot. Is it common for MS patients to have poor reflexes? What was he testing exactly?

He also got really concerned about some dry/painful eye I'd wake up with, only my left eye, along with even more concern about my right eye not being able to look all the way to the right. (though I'm almost certain this was just something I was born with, premature by 2 and half months. Never got confirmed by my family. For sure had it for years now.)

Due to this and all of my listed symptoms, he's suspecting MS (again) or some other autoimmune disease, and is making me do a c and t spine mri along with a spinal tap before April (which I'm REALLY dreading. Please tell me it'll go okay, the horror stories about awful headaches worries me so much.)

 Also, I've been mostly fine since later October. Some feet pins and needles/tingling every now and then, and muscle spasms in a couple spots, but once I got the bad news on Monday, I got worked up, and since then I've started to feel a lot worse. Can stress cause a flare up of symptoms/relapse? I've been getting back pains, lower and middle, and my neck... along with nausea and loose stool again, and some mild headaches. The tingling is still high but the numbness I was getting again thankfully seems to have already gotten better after just a couple of days, though the rest remains. Comes and goes in severity.

Thanks for any info on things.","What did my neuro do when testing my reflexes? And some other questions.

So I did what I normally do, I bit my tongue and took the car and off I went to work. As the day progressed I started to doubt whether my ankle was hurting because I twisted it. I had no real apparent bruising nor was my ankle extra thick. What I had have however was a very stiff joint that even without pressure put on it, couldn't be moved and I constantly felt it. So I took my medicine and a painkiller when I got home and am curious how this will progress.

I obviously know I need to speak to my neurologist about this ultimately, but I wanted to reach out and ask you guys if anyone has any experience with taking sleeping medications and lamitrogine at the same time, and if there were any complications/bad interactions. 

My main trigger is lack of sleep, and lately I've been finding myself unable to sleep very often. 

I largely use marijuana to get to sleep, and that works, but we can't always have it available, yeah? 

So that's it, just wanted to ask for some of yall's experiences with sleeping meds"
56,ryoykk,t5_2s23e,"[Rant] what did i do to deserve this?
(Sorry if this isnt allowed, or is in the wrong place.)

I was diagnosed this august, and am 3 infusions into 7. In some ways this is all new and foreign territory (being sick). 

I just got out of the rest room, at home, bladder empty. 30-40 minutes ago, i was at the hospital. Bladder so full and incapable of getting a urine sample out. See, my medication requires a negative pregnancy test before every transfusion. A uterus my age overrides the fact i have been celibate for 11 months. Fuck. 

A month ago, i spent three hours trying to urinate, and was at the infusion clinic for 5 hours, mostly waiting. Oh, and the stress constricted my veins to getting the IV was arduous. Driving home, i got horrifically lost. Needless to say i cant do more IVs without CBD gummies and ample lidocaine.

My continence had long been slipping, but this bladder hesitancy is new. Somedays, i get both: nearly wetting myself and then being un able to pee as soon as i reach the toilet. At least im fortunate that urology is on my chart notes. A month ago i dont think they took my inability to urinate as anything more than shyness. This time, the nurses were on it, not just letting me wait, and finally taking blood to test and pushed my appt put until Sunday am. Well.. cool. Thanks for the weekend! But also thanks for telling the urine test to fuck off. 

Lets be honest, single 33 year old woman does not want this to be her life. She does not want MS, she does not want the burden of infusions, and she does not want the simultaneous pressure to hydrate along with an absolute terror of having an accident because you hydrated.

Its the first symptom ive been utterly embarrassed to talk about, but its fundamentally wreaking havoc on my life. 

What the fuck.","[Rant] what did i do to deserve this?

I (25f) have been dealing with constipation for a realllllly long time. I've been to 4 gastroenterologists who have never been able to help me with my constipation, bloating, extreme gas, and all around uncomfortable feeling in my stomach. 

I've done everything I've been instructed to do. I tried Linzess for a while, no luck. I've tried Amitiza with no luck. I've tried Trulance with no luck. I do a stationary bike for exercise, I drink a TON of water, I eat fiber, yada yada you get the idea. I've tried drinking warm prune juice, but that's only made me *more* gassy and it causes my stomach to cramp. I've had to do several miralax + dulcolax cleanses, but they never ""clear"" me out. I do miralax daily. I've tried enemas and suppositories but they don't work. 

I'm seeing a new gastro who seems like he's thinking a bit more than the other ones so I'm somewhat hopeful. He had me do a sitz marker study and I just got it done. The xray on the fifth day said I had sitz markers throughout the descending and sigmoid colon and that I had a ""large colonic stool burden""... 

I'm so stressed out about this because I honest to god don't know what I can do. I'm so backed up and it's daunting to think that I have to get all of that out lol. Like, I have to, right? I can't leave it like this. But I don't know what my gastro is going to suggest to me and I'm nervous. I've tried so many things and nothing works.

Things have gotten much worse recently however and I am now at a point where getting up to go to the bathroom makes my heart pound extremely hard, and I can never seem to catch my breath at all.

They ordered for me to be screened for POTS but I ended up feeling better and didn't go. As things have gotten worse now, I will be seeing my GP tomorrow and asking about POTS as well as possibly asthma (because of how hard it is to breathe fully). What can I expect? Will they be able to test me there tomorrow?

So I have really severe epilepsy. Like 15-20 tonic clonic seizures a day plus atonic, partial and absent seizures. So I have seizure like a lot and often they are last quite a long time and often go on for 3-4 minutes. So cause I have a lot of seizures my school havent been so comfortable with me coming into school and my parents have a lot of responsibility making sure I am ok all the time cause it is like 24 hour care for me. We were told by our doctor I am eligible for a service dog about a year and a half ago now. Before covid. Cause of covid it took long to get it started. Finding a dog took a long time then training it. But I finally got my first service dog. She is a golden retriever called Kat. I got her a couple days ago and she is so amazing. She is there for me when I have seizures but also a good friend. I have never had a dog before but having in is amazing.

Been suffering with gout and high uric acid for the last 5 years. Tried all the remedies, weight loss, diet changes, removing alcohol, more water but i had some bad flare ups 4-5 a year and few minor ones between those.

Then it started moving from my toes, knees, ankles and even elbow.

So I finally went to a rheumatologist and got officially diagnosed. Got out on allopurinal and colchicine daily since April. Besides little tingles on my joints I have not had a single flare up since.

But I also maintain other things like staying hydrated, avoid too much beer, shellfish.

I hope I keep going with no flare ups. Most of the things I read about allo on Reddit and online have been really hopeful.

I have done the rounds of Lansaprosole, Omeprosole, Esomeprosole and Pantaprosole and they do definitely help with reflux. I'm currently on 40mg esomeprozole (20mg 2x a day) but I get a lot of side effects like:

Farting. So much farting. And really nasty ones too!

Sleep has not been great - in fact it's been worse since I came off coffee strangely - but I hear this can also be a side effect.

When I do sleep, I'm still really tired in the mornings - I can function, but it's noticeable.

Good old Folic acid deficiency.

For us lot with Barrett's, PPIs for life is the treatment plan. I wondered if either you'd found any other PPIs that had less side effects, or if there were any other treaments you had tried that had been effective?

Hey guys I'm new to all of this and believe I may be experiencing symptoms from POTS. Curious if you guys can help provide some more information so I can dial it down as my doctors are having trouble narrowing down.

At first I was having weird symptoms of feeling light headedness out of no where with brain fog and a feeling I might faint. Shortly after I'd catch a weird feeling in my body followed by anxiety. Went to the doctor and they ran blood, urine, and usual checkup and couldn't find anything. I was thinking maybe I'm diabetic or I'm lacking iron or something along these lines. All he stated was he thinks I may be dehydrated but I'm drinking about 1/2 gallon of water a day. The final symptoms which I'm not sure is even relevant is as I'm falling asleep, drifting unconscious, I have a panic attack. Whatever reason I think I'm dying and this is it and I'm fighting to wake myself up...

What stuck out to me was at my first doctors visit he took my blood pressure and bpm while I was laying down, sitting, and then standing up. He just made a weird comment that all these increased alot faster than is normal. Shortly after, I fought myself awake one night and I was googling all these symptoms and stumbled on POTS. Also how long Covid may cause POTS as all these symptoms started a month after I had the Delta variant.

Any help would be appreciated as I'm getting exhausted dealing with these symptoms. The daily anxiety, trouble falling asleep, ext. I'm a 29 male, 165 lbs with minimal stress living in alaska.","More information regarding POTS

Im currently on 40 mg pantaprozole (1 tablet daily every morning - 30 mins before meals). It seems to be helping with my acid reflux and i dont get heartburns anymore.

However, i am scared to trigger my acid reflux. 

Would just like to check what are the things that you guys consume on a daily basis to not trigger your acid reflux. 

1. Do you guys completely stay away from coffee?
2. Is occasional alcohol allowed in a moderate amount during social events?
3. What kind of daily food do you guys consume ? (im in Singapore)","Those with Acid Reflux - What do you consume on a daily basis?

107,rv7vmp,t5_2qlaa,"PPI withdrawal heart side effects?
I've been dealing with reflux and gastritis since June of 2020 so I started taking omeprazole (which screwed up my stomach BIG TIME and I'm convinced is actually what ruined my body instead of my minor nighttime reflux I started taking it for).

After months of dealing with that I tried dropping it for something else, but I started getting major heart palpitations and would wake up with my heart racing like 120-130bpm. It would keep happening throughout the day but all my doctors said it was anxiety (since I've had issues with that most of my life) but I know my body well enough to know the difference.

I hopped onto 40mg pantoprazole and some daily anxiety meds from a psychiatrist which seemed to make the heart stuff go away at first and my stomach improved just from getting off the omeprazole, but I still havent been able to really eat and the 'correct foods' are still bothering me. 

Long story short, I've messed with my panto doses like 3 times and each time after a few days of either pausing it or cutting it in half I've had all the heart stuff come back, even with me still taking my anxiety meds. I did have a lot of testing done last year from my cardio (granted everything I did came after I got the meds so my heart had calmed down) which all came back normal, but when I ask my doctors about these side effects from stopping PPIs they all just kinda look at me, shrug, and say I'm a weird case and it's anxiety.

I've got a new GI doc who seems nicer and wants to get me off them onto some famotidine, but in the process of weaning off getting there to try that I'm back to the same square of a constant racing heart and palpitations. It's been almost two weeks now and the only thing kinda keeping them in check is me taking my emergency panic attack meds.

I've read stories about people having this kind of stuff happen WHILE they're taking it, but has anyone had any bad side effects getting off them like this? I kinda just need to know I'm not alone since my other doctors all point at each other in a circle and say 'ask that one'.","PPI withdrawal heart side effects?

Hello to all. Full disclosure: I have mixed connective tissue disease rather than Lupus, but they are ""sister"" conditions due to symptom overlap. I also have fibro and dystonia, a neurological movement disorder.

I have ""bronchitis"" following a likely case of covid (long covid, anyone?) and my doc started me on high dose prednisone today. Am I the only one who dreads having to take prednisone? I understand it's necessary for me to kick infections and downplay my immune system during severe flares but man, how I hate it. 

I get the flushing like I'm on fire from within, starving all the time but too weak to do any sort of cooking, I bruise if you even LOOK at me too hard, fluid retention like a mother, and it exacerbates my tremors from my neurological motor dysfunction. I just absolutely hate it.

On the bright side, my MCTD flares are far in between and often so mild I can get by without having to take prednisone, so I usually only take it when I have a respiratory infection. Which, since covid masking, happens much more rarely than it used to. But I do dread the day that the MCTD gets more severe, resulting in needing prednisone on the regular. 

Am I the only one who gets such awful prednisone side effects? I'd like to know I'm not alone in this.

I'm 42 and was diagnosed when I was 19.

The last seizure was two years ago and I ended up the last two examples along with pulling every muscle in both arms.

The only thing I'm good at is art and it hurts so much when I do try to draw. I haven't drawn anything in three months because I was tearing up from the pain. I left the factory I was working at when it happened because it made the migraines and pain worse. And I was such a hard worker. A good worker. Also I was treated differently, which if this was school, I would be the ""special"" kid. Hell, I've always been treated differently. Like I was a plague.

I could keep going but another migraine is hitting me and I must lay down. Let me get to the point: thanks to Epilepsy, my life has been complete shit.

TLDR; Mexico HSCT 15 months post - MRI stable! Symptoms stable! Promoted at work! Need many years to know if it worked as well as I hope.

Hello all, I thought Id give another update on my experience so far after my most recent appointment. 

The treatment itself hasnt led to any real side effects that I have noticed. My cell counts were low for the first 6 months or so as expected, but since 6 months post I am no longer immunocompromised! Had an asymptomatic viral reactivation that didnt require treatment and dipped back into neutropenia for a period, but I had no symptoms.

MS wise, it hasnt been a total magic bullet. I still get tingles or numbness here and there sometimes, and maybe Im a bit fatigued (but thats hard to measure). The lesions are all still there, with maybe a bit of improvement on a few.

Even so, my MRIs are stable so far and Im hopeful they may continue to be. I asked my doc and he agreed Ocrevus would have likely done the same thing but that my gamble with HSCT ""appears to be paying off"" so far. My reasoning with HSCT is for 5+ year brain volume loss prevention and to avoid ongoing immunosuppression. So that will take a lot of time to get a final verdict. 

At work I've been promoted and I hope this treatment will help me use my brain for many years!

Im taking R-ALA, Vit D 15k / day, a B complex, and Omegas for supplements; though I have no way of really knowing if they are helping. I eat mostly pescatarian and have kept active with running/walking a bunch. 

As always feel free to ask questions here or PM. Im not a doctor but I do have opinions that may or may not be correct :)

Hi Reddit.
Im a 19 year old girl.

Ive had temporal lobe epilepsy for about 7.5 years, and have an average of 5 seizures a month or so I thought.

Ive been on 5 different medications (Sodium Valproate, Lamotrigine, Keppra, Ethosuximide, Briviact) and all of them havent slowed or stopped my seizures.
Over the years its gotten worse and worse, starting off with simple partial, then complex partial, now generalised epilepsy.

My neurologist didnt believe me. He said that he believed all of them were psychological seizures or pseudo seizures. He didnt believe me because when doing EEGs in a doctors office I was never able to set off a seizure.

So, three months ago I decided to do an at home 7 day video EEG. 
Turns out Im having about 18 seizures a week, 13 of them in my sleep, 5 during the day. I just never remember the ones during the day because I live alone.
My neurologist didnt take the news well, Im sure because it was a hit to his ego.

But here I am now.
I dont know how to take this news. 
Im trying to look on the bright side, at least I know whats going on now, but its hard. 
I just dont know what to think. 
Ever since hearing the results Ive spiralled into a depression and am anxious of how much damage this has been doing to my brain over the past 7.5 years.

So, reddit, this was partly me getting everything off my chest, but mainly a request for some advice.
How do you deal with results?
How do you cope with the depression after a seizure?
How do you cope with memory issues?

Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone! I'm fairly new to this community but have had problems since October and I've been to multiple doctors and the ER and a dietian. I'm seeing a GI soon. But I've been consistently constipated for about 2 months now after going back and forth since October between diarrhea and constipation I eat my ""safe"" foods but I still can't go to the bathroom. I'm taking multiple laxatives a day and a lot of extra fiber. I have been eating relatively healthy. But now even when I do a suppository or an enema I still can't get it all out. Any suggestions? 

Also besides this fact I got a lot of weight gain very fast at the start of this like October or so and even though I'm walking 2-4 miles a day and barley eating any food and drinking a ton of water I still stay the same weight that fluctuates a few pounds but stays the same relatively. Has this happened with anyone else?","IBS

Tonics are roughly a once a year event for me.

Focals are daily/weekly.

At work earlier tonight I was going about a normal evening when my auras hit and my brain went sideways.  I vaguely remember grabbing the edge of the counter and holding myself up poorly.  Then a co worker helping guide me safely to the floor while I groaned gibberish.  One of my friends grabbed my phone and called my wife.  They called EMS.  By the time EMS showed I had returned to a semi lucid state and was able to answer questions but I wouldn't let them load me up and take me to the ER.  My wife arrived a couple minutes later and between my wife and coworkers they were able to get me into the car and home.

Upon arriving home I discovered two issues.  The most mortifying was that I had shit my pants.  It's only happened once before.  I just threw my pants away.  The second issue was that the Nausea that normally would be mild went big and I started projectile vomiting.

My Neuro recently decreased my dose of Lamotrigine and prescribed me Aptiom.  Because my meds are being altered, I knew this was a possibility.  But knowing it could happen doesn't make it any less annoying when it does.","Rough Night at work

148,s3d99l,t5_2s23e,"RESEARCH: Longitudinal, 20-year Study, Shows EBV May Trigger MS
For decades, researchers have suspected that people infected with an exceedingly common virus, Epstein-Barr, might be more likely to develop multiple sclerosis, a neurological illness that affects a million people in the United States. Now, a team of researchers reports what some say is the most compelling evidence yet of a strong link between the two diseases.

The virus infects nearly everyone in their teen or young adult years, and very few go on to develop multiple sclerosis. **The researchers also note that it is not the only known risk factor for people who develop the illness. But they say their data points to it being the clearest of them all.** While it remains to be seen whether the finding will result in treatments or cures for multiple sclerosis, the study may further motivate research into therapies and vaccines for the condition.

In their [*study*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222), published Thursday in Science, the group examined data from 10 million people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces over two decades. The strength of their study, said its principal investigator, Dr. Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, is that they were able to follow people for years and ask whether infections with Epstein-Barr preceded multiple sclerosis.

Among the service members in the study, 801 developed multiple sclerosis.

At the same time, the virus in question, Epstein-Barr, is common, infecting nearly everyone in the population at some point. Although few are aware that they were infected, some develop mononucleosis. The virus remains in the body for life.

**Because so few who are infected with the virus get multiple sclerosis, it cannot be the sole cause of the disease. Other risk factors have been identified, including some, like low levels of vitamin D and smoking, that were seen previously by the Harvard group using the same data set. There also are genetic factors  900 abnormal genes have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis, said Dr. Anthony J. Reder, a multiple sclerosis expert at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new study. Gender also plays a role; most patients are women.**

But, Dr. Ascherio said, *no risk factor stands out like Epstein-Barr infections.*

**To ask how much the virus increases risk, the investigators studied the small proportion of people who were not infected with the virus early in their service careers but subsequently became infected. They detected infections by the presence of antibodies to the virus.**

**Among the multiple sclerosis patients, 32 out of 33 got infected with Epstein-Barr before they developed M.S.**

As a control group for their study, the scientists tracked 90 individuals who were not initially infected with Epstein-Barr and who also did not get multiple sclerosis. **Of them, just 51 subsequently became infected with Epstein-Barr. That meant an Epstein-Barr virus infection increased the risk of multiple sclerosis over thirtyfold, Dr. Ascherio said.**

But Dr. Reder cautioned that it could be hard to tease out cause and effect from an epidemiological study. People who develop multiple sclerosis have overactive immune systems that make them develop high levels of antibodies to viral infections. Multiple sclerosis might arise not because of the virus but because of the bodys response to it.

*Multiple sclerosis patients have fewer viral infections than normal, he said, because their immune systems are so active that they effectively fight off viruses. Multiple sclerosis patients often say, I never get a cold. When I hear that, my ears perk up.*

So far, he added, anti-viral drugs have not helped patients with multiple sclerosis.

The Harvard group tried to control for the possibility that the immune systems response, not the virus itself, increases the risk of multiple sclerosis in those infected with Epstein-Barr. They asked if antibodies to another common virus, cytomegalovirus, also were linked to a greater risk of multiple sclerosis. They were not.

But cytomegalovirus, Dr. Reder said, for unknown reasons, seems to protect against multiple sclerosis. So the fact that those infected with it did not have a higher risk of multiple sclerosis might not be surprising.

Others said the study was convincing evidence of cause and effect.

*The way it was done is quite compelling, said Dr. Michael Davin Kornberg, a multiple sclerosis specialist at Johns Hopkins. It really is the most convincing data weve had for a causal association.*

Dr. Bruce Cree, a multiple sclerosis researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, noted that it might be difficult to treat multiple sclerosis by going after Epstein-Barr because it can be difficult to find the actual virus in patients. Even though multiple sclerosis is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, he could not find the virus in patients spinal fluid.

But patients do seem to harbor cells in their brains that produce antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. Dr. Cree is researching whether he can treat multiple sclerosis patients by eradicating those cells, which are infected with Epstein-Barr.

And Dr. Lawrence Steinman, a multiple sclerosis researcher at Stanford, who wrote a perspective accompanying the Harvard groups paper, said an experimental mRNA vaccine against Epstein-Barr was one of a number of approaches being designed to stop the virus from affecting the brain.

The question now, he said, is, ***Can we make multiple sclerosis go away?***

So, I'm pretty sure I've had gout for years(as recently years worth of problem joints are basically gone?), and 3 months ago I got tested and confirmed with a Uric Acid level over 12!!!  
The doctor Didn't want to prescribe me meds and said just ending alcohol consumption at first. This seemed silly and I investigated and overhauled my diet completely. The following changes dropped me from a 12 to an 8.5 over a 6 week period.  
100 grams meat daily max, none of it ever pork, normally steak or salmon.  
My non water beverages became tea and coffee only(my youtube channel  has quite a few of these, the latest is a burdock and grape based drink to get urine flowing in conjunction with Allo:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LbfCpksI\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LbfCpksI_w))  
A lot of eggs for protein.  
A lot of yogurt added to my diet.  
No Alcohol. No Meat broth soups(bone broth is okay). No Fast Food.

  


When this didn't get me as low as I wanted I found a new doctor and showed him my records and diet. HE finally prescribed me 100 mg allo daily. I saw someone on here mention donating blood, the concept being that the blood letting would take the acid in the blood out, and your body generates new non uric blood. I decided to try, but instead with wet cupping, as this can draw crystals out of your muscle, joint, and fat tissues(theoretically) as well. After 6 weeks of wet cupping 3 days a week, and daily medication my score is now a 4.8. I thought this wouldn't happen so quickly and thought I was facing a multiple year struggle. I'm not sure to what extent each of these factors helped, so I am going to do 6 weeks of no cupping, keep diet and allo intake the same and see the results.  


I hope some of this can help others, and I highly recommend people be proactive in treating their gout with medicine + diet+ lifestyle.

Hey everyone, 

Im a  29 years old male and I was diagnosed with GERD about 1.5 years ago. I was able to keep it at bay for awhile, until June of this year. Starting getting intense burning and pain In my throat which made me finally give in and take a PPI. I was prescribed 40mg of pantroprazole once a day. Took it for a week and half amd decide to give it up as I was feeling like my symptoms were getting worse. Well.  2 weeks after my symptoms seemed to clear up for the most part. Decided to enjoy a couple beers a few days while on Vacation and experienced no reflux or pain. A couple more weeks go by and I wake up with a stabbing/cramping pain in my left middle/lower abdomen. Doesn't last long

Now from this day on everytime i eat, about 2 hours later i start getting insanely thirsty, lots of mucus forming in back of throat, and get some gnarly stomach discomfort for quite a while. Water doesn't help the thrist and causes immediate reflux. Lost even more weight despite eating (5'9 and 120lbs). I also Occasionally will get that stabbing or cramping pain in mid/lower abdomen. It sucks.. I thought the reflux was annoying but now this is just concerning. 

The thing is, In September before these new symptoms popped up i had a HIDA scan, endoscopy, blood work, and ultra sounds and everything looked perfect.  Doctor said I should eat whatever I want,  go figure.. idk. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms with their GERD or any other condition? Or did yours start after PPIs? It's driving me crazy and the weight loss is starting to get to me. 

Your comments are appreciated","New issues after PPI. Had anyone experienced?

Hi everyone! I'm always interested to hear about other people's experiences with CF, so I thought I would introduce myself and share a bit about my own experiences. 

I (she/her) am 32, born and raised in Canada. I was diagnosed at 2 years old, and I'm the first (and so far only) person in my extended family who has CF. I have one copy of F508Del, and another more rare one (R560T).

My main CF challenge is with MRSA in my lungs, which flares up about every 2-3 months. Lately, I've mostly been able to manage it with oral antibiotics, which has been nice. For physio, I use a PEP mask in combination with salbutamol and advair puffers, as well as hypertonic saline and pulmozyme. I use a Philips InnoSpire Go to nebulize my meds, and I absolutely love it! I also take the usual enzymes, supplements, etc., and I'm on azithromycin 3 times per week. My PFTs are usually around 80-90% when healthy, and 65-70% during an exacerbation.

I had pseudomonas as a teenager, but we were pretty aggressive with treating it, and suddenly in my early twenties, I just stopped growing it.  I feel pretty lucky about that. I've had sinus surgery, and some pseudomonas did show up in the culture from that surgery, but it seems to be contained to my sinuses.

I have been married for 6 years, and this year my husband and I welcomed our little daughter into the world! She is 6 months old now, and having her has been the most incredible gift of my life. My pregnancy actually went quite smoothly, which was also such a gift! I did have gestational diabetes, but was able to manage it with insulin and diet.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education, but CF prevents me from working full-time in schools (aka germ factories), so I work for a non-profit literacy organization. I coordinate our children's programs, and I love it! I'm able to work from home, and it's not too many hours, so it works well for me. I am also on Disability, which has informed my stance that Universal Basic Income would be an incredibly positive thing for society.

I'm on the CF Patient Advisory Committee for my clinic, and I'm always open to talking about all things CF, so I hope to hear from some of you here!

Take care everyone! ","Happy to be in the group!

Hi, 
I'm finally here on this sub after bothering all the other ones I could think of.

Long story short, took medication(ones that could upset the lining of your stomach) and since then, even tho it was only ten days, I've had mild constipation(sorry TMI) and what my doctor says is GERD. 

He says I must try taking Omeoprozol for 8 weeks. I was taking this same time as the meds to try avoid this. 

My whole family basically takes Omeoprozol or lanzoprozol permanently and I always wished I could avoid that! They don't hate it but...

Anyone appreciate Omeoprozol personally? Recommend it? Other options before I start? I feel like this may be a slippery slope to forever taking it.

I don't feel like I can be in this low key burning chest pain on and off 24/7 anymore tho so I guess I must try what the GP says?!

Questions for and about Meth Using/users vs. Possible psychosis. 

TLDR: does meth smell pungent? Could you smell it if someone smokes in their room? Is it possible to hold very small conversation on a low dose? Do meth smokers accuse people of smoking meth. When backed into a corner?

Ok, so my long term friend and roommate for the past two years and I have recently had to find a third roommate. We found one and thought it was going to be an easy 6 month lease. He lived with us for 10 days, just up and moved out with 
absurd accusations on his way out.

We had posted an ad about needing a new roommate as our current one was moving out (no bad blood, they were fantastic, just wanted to move back home). In the ad, we had listed 420 friendly. Received a message of interest from this guy who said hed like to come view the place.

The guy shows up visibly very nervous, barely any talking. We just assumed he was nervous.

During the viewing, my friend and I were very clear that she smokes a lot of weed and occasionally in the house, but if that was a problem, she would totally do it outside. The guy said that was totally fine and was actually looking for a place as such. He was definitely hitting what looked like a dab pen, nothing weird. My friend then asked if he wanted a bong rip or two and he said he was game. We then asked if he wanted to play some Mario kart to ease up the vibe. Went well. He then said, alright, Im pretty fucking high. We like reassure him dude, its totally chill we get it. He seemed alright. We asked him if he had any last questions, and he said, no, so we were like chill, we will contact you soon. 

Had a couple other prospectives view the place and decided to go with him as out co-tenant.

Through out the 10 days he lived with us, Id seen him hit the bong on two different occasions, and smoke out of a pipe (but I dont distincly remember smelling weed, brushed it off. All attempted conversations with this guy ended with him saying, sorry Im just too fucking high, so Im like sure no problem do what makes you feel comfortable or whatever. Like go in your room, go to sleep, eat something, drink some water, etc.

My roommate also smokes dabs time to time, as well as my partner who comes over frequently. No more than 7 dabs are taken over the course of 24 hours.

Other really uncomfortable situations happened also took place, but not really connected to the main issue.

2 nights go, he packs up all his shit at two a.m. (my partner works nights so I was awake still and VERY confused). I was hey, dude, is everything ok?

Im sorry, but I just gotta go, you guys need to find someone to cover the lease

Uh? Ok? We need to talk about this as a house hold tomorrow. But like whats up? Is there anything going on? Is there something that I can help with? -me

No, you guys are cool people, but you gotta find someone else. Blah blah Im just too fucking high (this phrase I heard over 10 times in the time he lived with us. Not an exaggeration.)

Uhm, alright?

Started thinking like, what is he high on? Ive only seen him smoke weed a max of 3 times in those 10 days.

So I was ok doesnt seem like he want to reconcile. Well talk in the morning.

The next morning. Hes having a conversation with my roommate, who is also very confused. Asking what is going on? Why are you feeling like you have to leave? You have a legal responsibility for a third of the rent, and so forth.

He proceed to accuse my roommate, and friend of ten years. Who has a steady job, is never late on rent, and is completely coherent any time Ive talked to her, of DOING METH. Saying the house smells of chemicals.

She says thats absolutely absurd. There is no feasible way that she or anyone else in the house is doing that. (this I overheard standing in the hallway).

I come out at that point to join the conversation. He then procedures to assert the smell of chemicals is coming from my room. I have been sober from weed for two months and have never smoked in my room.

I tell him that, and say that the only smoking done in this house takes place at the dining room table or out on the porch.

At this point, my roommate asks him if he has any mental diagnosis that include paranoia as we are a neurodivergent household and understand this (my roomie has a mental diagnosis, I have BP1- I know paranoia and psychosis).

I have a feeling he was maybe smoking meth?? since that accusation came out of nowhere Alcoholics accuse people of drinking; cheaters accuse people of cheating.

-he has no job
-Says hes doin online school, but neither of us know that for sure.
-his parents also very against co-signing for him.

Is he a possible meth user or is he psychotic?

I have noticed a trend the past year. Whenever I sleep <5hrs I tend to suffer less from lightheadedness/fatigue/constant fog throughout the day. The longer I sleep >7hrs the worse my symptoms are. Dont get me wrong, whenever I sleep 3-5hrs I feel terrible from the sleep deprivation however it is 1000% preferable to sleeping 8hrs and having horrible POTS symptoms.

I also seem to notice a similar relief of symptoms the day after consuming alcohol. I assume that it is because after consuming alcohol, as well as being sleep deprived, my heart pumps harder(and more efficiently?) this is what Ive noticed in my situation.

180,rpiop6,t5_2qlaa,"Dying to eat after what could be potentially bad GERD
Hi there everyone. I need help. It's been a few days and I can't seem to eat or have normal bowel function after a Gerd flare. The first time I got sick was on 21 November and I had been sick for 5 to 6 days. Doctor said there were three possibilities: GERD, Gallstones or an obstruction in my stomach (but this last one was quite rare). I was given omerprazole, anti nausea meds and was told to have a clean diet. I'm sorry to admit that I cheated a bit after having lemon and herb marinated grilled chicken and beef stroganoff made with soy milk and pasta but for the most part my diet was weetbix in the morning, a legume salad with chicken or tuna and a small snack for dinner (apples or bananas). Anyways I used the Omerprazole until I ran out of it and after that a few days passed without incident although I did start developing a sore throat. Then after that I got ill again. What a nightmare. This time it was almost exactly a month later and it was worse. I mean bad. I kept coughing and vomiting up saliva. My stomach felt like a churning pot of bubbles and I couldn't have normal bowel movement at all. I even started getting the flavor of having recently eaten an orange on my tongue. Once again I rushed to a doctor who gave me Lansoprazole. This didn't help at all and I saw no improvement. I rushed to the hospital again on Christmas Day in tears, scared for my life and the doctor just dispassionate looked at me and said, it's GERD. I was basically told to figure it out myself. I have successfully acquired appointments for the 14th of January but now how do I get there alive and in one piece? I'm really struggling to eat and I think because my stomach is so empty, the acid is going berserk. Please help.

My gf is about to switch from once a day copaxon injections to aubagio at the advice of her new neurologist.

After doing some research before starting the treatment, she is a bit worried about the liver function concerns with the drug. 

My gf is bipolar, has high anxiety, and is on several meds for her mental health. I just pulled up a site that compared these 2 drugs and was really angry to see that copaxone patients reported it caused depression, anxiety, and other things the doctor never mentioned. So I am cautiously optimistic that the change is in her best interest. 

Any thoughts or experiences would be greatly appreciated. My research seems to lean towards the new medication, but we are obviously concerned at least about the liver function monitoring.

Hello everyone! I have been struggling with lupus symptoms for a few years, but they were milder so I couldnt get an official diagnosis.

What can I expect from my first visits? The general physician gave me low dose prednisone for five days to take and hopefully ease up symptoms until the specialist can get me in.  I know kidneys can be an issue, but they said my labs showed kidney function was fine right now. Will my flare ups slowly get worse? Are there treatments that minimize them?

199,oyb963,t5_2r876,"Fear of death
The level of treatment I have access to is an enormous  blessing that I *do not take for granted* for one second, but as many people have discussed there's a kind of weird psychological ""crisis"" you go through where enough time seems on the table for you that it reframes you perspective towards life.

Not just time of course, because I personally feel I still only have a few years in the tank, but the *quality* of life that makes all the difference (for example, if I was in crap health and had two years, I wouldn't enroll in school because that's not how i want to fill the time, but if I had three years and felt amazing maybe I'd be up to it since I'd have the energy to tackle it).

Anyway, I know some people are talking about, ""Oh shit, I wasn't supposed to be here, what do I do with myself now?"" But right now my thing is more, and I know this is horrible to say, I was kind of counting on being gone right now with the one silver living that I wouldn't have to watch everyone around me go.

We don't know when that time is going to come for anyone, but I see friends and family getting older and sicker (or if they're healthier, their stories turning out more shit when they make bad choices) and it feels like *my* life is just beginning but only with enough window to see the end of everyone else's.

So my fear of death isn't necessarily for myself (I can't feel that anymore as I'm overexposed to it) but more about death broadly. I've had such a bad experience a long time ago with someone close that it feeling like it's hanging around the corner waiting to snatch up everyone I care about...it makes it hard to function.

And there's no outlet. I can't talk to the people it concerns (I am willing to but they personally aren't comfortable or willing or able) and therapy kind of things seem to go nowhere.

I feel I am actually pretty well-adjusted and have never properly screened for a clinical mental issue -- just thinking out loud as far as coping mechanisms. It sometimes feels like it manifests as physical pain.","Fear of death

Im hoping to spend most of the next year outside doing lots of fun alpine things since Ive got some time off work but there are a couple things Ive struggled with in the past trying to manage gerd in the backcountry. 

1) its really hard to eat enough. I really need to eat small meals or else I feel disgusting and I also am sensitive to certain kinds of foods, like nut bars or trail mix which used to be a go-to make me feel so sick. But its obviously crucial to stay well fed when youre working so hard all day long. Im curious if others have found safe and calorie dense foods to eat and/or ways of eating that dont aggravate your gerd but allow you to eat enough. 

2) sleeping on the ground. At home I have the head of my bed raised and it helps so much. If there are a couple nights where I dont sleep at home its just a little scratchy throat but after a few days it starts to get worse so Im curious if anyone has any backcountry set ups that work well for raising the top half of your body a bit while sleeping. 

Any other thoughts/tips on GERD and the outdoors are welcome too! Many thanks!","Any backpackers/scramblers/mountaineers have tips?

Hey r/IBS, Im not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I think it might help me process my situation by just getting it out.

I dont really post in this sub, but I love reading all the posts and seeing how supportive this community is. Just reading other peoples posts has really helped me over the years

TL:DR  Doctors never tested me for coeliac as part of IBS diagnosis at age 14. 10 years on I request the test myself and its positive. Ree.

&#x200B;

Here is my story 

Ten years ago at the ripe old age of 14 my digestion issues started. With a childhood history of constipation, everything flipped, and I was battling with constant nausea, diarrhea, bloating, iron deficiency, headaches, fatigue, serious cramping, trapped wind and more. Eventually my mum takes me to the doctor and they test me for everything. All my bloods come back normal-ish. Life goes on, just a little more sh\*tty (lol).

At 15 I finally got my period and things got a bit worse. My digestion issues got a bit worse, I was more iron deficient and the migraines started. Over the next year or two I get more blood tests, more normal-ish ranges for most things. Im told because there is nothing wrong with me, so I have IBS.

Here we welcome all the damaging comments from friends, family, class-mates and health professionals:

\- at least youre not as sick as so and so uhh no Ive just delt with it longer and dont talk about it as much.

\- at least youre not coeliac or have Crohns

\- at least your body isnt actually attacking itself (HAHAHA JUST WAIT)

\- Them: I feel sick today can you help me? me: Im really sorry Im not feeling too well myself, I cant really help no. them: but youre at school, but you look fine. Its really not a competition you know

\- its just the runs, its just nausea its just \*insert any symptom\*

\- its all in your head

\- IBS isnt a real health issue

\- no, you cant be sick constantly? Because I see youre still living your life

\- at least youve never pooped yourself HAHA Its not something I publicize

After years of trying to figure out what makes me sick and what doesnt, Ive cut out a bunch of foods, or only eat them in small quantities, and other foods I just cop the consequences because I want to live a normal life on the outside, so Id rather just suffer quietly on the inside / in my loo. I have found my diet particularly hard, because even when I cut out EVERY major trigger food and tried to follow diets I was still getting mild symptoms. So why not just suffer a little bit more if it means I get to socialize a little bit more. Sounded like a fair trade off to me considering I never received any advice on my diet and everything I knew was research done by a teenager.

After about 5 years, and finishing school I decided, well, this is the way I am made but its ok. Im resilient and yes, I do suffer, but I wont talk about it because it doesnt achieve anything. Id prefer not to talk about it because I was over the damaging comments. I was honestly coping ok because mentally I felt like I had to. If I focused on my symptoms I would not be living. 

The last 2 years things have got a little bit worse again. Urgency to poop has increased along with frequency of diarrhea and very foul-smelling farts, development of lactose intolerance, more cramps, just generally feeling like trash. This starts to really impact my mental health. But ya know, thats just the way I am so its ok. I start to eat low fodmaps and do feel a bit better. Things are ok because they have to be ok... right?

Now heres where my story gets a bit spicy.

2 months ago my very healthy (he literally is never unwell) partner is sick for about 2 weeks and gets tested for a bunch of things, one of them coeliac. He tests positive. Everyone is shocked because he has never had any digestive or non-specific coeliac symptoms. He is honestly so well!

After some research I realized wow, a lot of my symptoms / health concerns (both digestive and non- digestive), sound like coeliac symptoms I should make sure I was tested. I sifted through all my old blood tests online for the past 10 years and NOT A SINGLE DOCTOR tested me for coeliac. I requested this myself and I tested positive.

For the past 10 years I have been suffering as an undiagnosed coeliac that has 8/10 of the most common symptoms. No one has ever listened to me. I feel so ignored, missed and like the health system has failed me. Part of the IBS diagnosis is being tested for coeliac, so how has this been missed by so many doctors!?!?!

After speaking to a specialist, she thinks my IBS COULD (not 100% certain) be induced by the coeliac because of the ongoing damage in subjecting my bowels to by eating gluten. So maybe I could eat onions again in the future?! 

As I said, I was coping with my symptoms, its just the way I was and something I just had to deal with. Now however, I am not coping. I know what is causing my symptoms Im so angry. I feel like Im grieving for my younger self. The teenager who took so much time off school, the uni student who struggled to concentrate, and the 24 year old who pooped herself in the kitchen. All of this could have been prevented if someone had just tested me which is supposed to be part of the IBS diagnosis. I wish I was able to advocate for myself at the time, but 14 y/o me just didnt know.

I now feel like Im super conscious of my symptoms and Im hyper fixating on them. In 2 more weeks, I know it will all be over. Ill have my gastroscopy to see how bad the damage is then I can go gluten free. I just have to last 2 more weeks but Im struggling. I feel like all food is hurting me and forcing myself to eat something I know is making me sick is so hard.

Wow that was a little bit of a ramble, but I do feel better for writing it I just needed somewhere to speak my mind and my frustrations. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.","Im a bit mad and a bit sad

Ive had epilepsy for 10+ years, but was only recently diagnosed, like within the past two years.

My seizures started occurring during puberty, and because they werent really bad (tonic clonic movie seizures) I brushed them off as bad headaches.

My right arm was shaking like crazy. I dont think Id ever tried to talk during a seizure before, so I never realized I couldnt. Scared the crap out of me.

He wasnt allowed to go in with me, early Covid protocols. I was alone for hours. Wondering what was going on. Dont remember anything else the nurse said except seizure, and when I was confused, she tried to backtrack because she realized the doctor hadnt talked to me yet.

Even now Im not fully sure whats going on. I know I have a mixture of focal and absent (?) seizures. I only really know one or two of my triggers.

Sometimes when people find out they try to coddle me, but I lived so long just fine not knowing. Recently Ive started feeling down about it again. Like, yeah, it sucks, but I dont know how to get people to understand epilepsy doesnt mean Im fragile or an emergency case.","Recent diagnosis

221,rv29pd,t5_2qlaa,"Strong acid-reflux, chest pain and mild swallowing troubles in the esophagus since years - how likely is cancer? Am i panicking for a reason?
Hey there,

Im sure there is many like me who panic and come here, but i really am not having mild panic anymore, it's getting too much to handle, so until i can finally get a doc's appointment (covid makes it hard to get one currently) i thought i could at least hear some calming words - possibly.

Short-ish history: I've had stronger issues with heartburn, acid-reflux and such for about 4 years now. I didn't simply ignore it - i first tried to make it go away by using sodium bicarbonate, which helped a little but ultimately not anymore for the first year. Then i used pantropazole for 2 years (20 mg per day), which is a PPI surpresser most of you probably know. It certainly made the symptoms go away 90% but i knew it was still there, just not feeling it as much.

Finally i decided to not take it anymore and instead focus on eating better, drinking less alcohol, and taking various supplements that a nutrionist recommended to me and finally, i'm feeling a lot better than ever, with even the meals or drinks that used to immediatly flare me up, not being remotely hard on me anymore.

Let it be noted, that im quite a heavy smoker (about 20 cigs a day) and also had a drinking problem throughout those 4 years (roughly 40 units of alcohol per week), which im now trying to quit as well. Also my life in those years was very stressful, which is luckily finally slowing down as well.

I have never felt better regarding the symptoms, but it could also just be a the beginning of a worse stage, where the symptos disappear (barret syndrome) as i've read (which i clearly have done way too much). Anyways, i've definitely decided that i want this checked out NOW, even if it's so late into the thing.

How high are the chances of this actually being something that can't be fixed anymore? Like esophageal cancer? Especially worried about the lump-like thing that sometimes prevents me from swallowing food down more easily behind my chest. Could that just be a stricture? I'm 28 by the way and im totally feeling stupid for all of it and don't want to wait longer, but i really am getting scared..","Strong acid-reflux, chest pain and mild swallowing troubles in the esophagus since years - how likely is cancer?

It certainly made the symptoms go away 90% but i knew it was still there, just not feeling it as much.

Finally i decided to not take it anymore and instead focus on eating better, drinking less alcohol, and taking various supplements that a nutrionist recommended to me and finally, i'm feeling a lot better than ever, with even the meals or drinks that used to immediatly flare me up, not being remotely hard on me anymore.

Let it be noted, that im quite a heavy smoker (about 20 cigs a day) and also had a drinking problem throughout those 4 years (roughly 40 units of alcohol per week), which im now trying to quit as well. Also my life in those years was very stressful, which is luckily finally slowing down as well.

I have never felt better regarding the symptoms, but it could also just be a the beginning of a worse stage, where the symptos disappear (barret syndrome) as i've read (which i clearly have done way too much). Anyways, i've definitely decided that i want this checked out NOW, even if it's so late into the thing.

How high are the chances of this actually being something that can't be fixed anymore? Like esophageal cancer? Especially worried about the lump-like thing that sometimes prevents me from swallowing food down more easily behind my chest. Could that just be a stricture? I'm 28 by the way and im totally feeling stupid for all of it and don't want to wait longer, but i really am getting scared.."

223,rs3hxe,t5_2s1h9,"Terrified for my dad
My dad just got diagnosed with (potentially temporal lobe) epilepsy. He is 59 years old and has had three tonic clonic seizures and several focal seizures within a month. For a few months before that he had some symptoms that he interpreted as panic attacks (probably seizures). The months leading up to his first tonic clonic was extremely stressful for him which maybe contributed to all this. Everything with this has been so damn scary.
  
Some questions: 

* 	Is it common that that you get so many seizures close in time when you are first diagnosed with epilepsy? 

* Recovery time especially after the tonic clonics has been around 10 days for my dad. During this time he is not himself at all; very sleepy, exhausted, very poor memory, confused. Is this normal and can anything be done to shorten this time? He has hardly been himself between the attacks because they have been so close and recovery is so long. :(
* He was put on Keppra after the second tonic clonic but after a few days on Keppra he talked like he had dementia.  Extremely confused and like he was almost not there. Doctors thought Keppra might have contributed to this and switched to Tegretol (slow release). Does anyone else have had this experience with Keppra?


Im terrified he will keep having tonic clonics this often given his recovery time. That would be like losing my dad and be absolutely horrifying for him. He has been on Tegretol for a few days now and so far no new seizures but Im really scared he will get new ones.

*   If he has new seizures on his new medicine within the next few weeks, does that mean this medicine is not working?","Terrified for my dad

My husband has epilepsy. He recently had a fall that was not connected to a seizure, but he lost his balance badly. Due to the vertigo, his neurologist has ordered that he wear a 30 day heart monitor, which he received two days ago. The discomfort he has experienced from the device has disrupted his sleep so much that he has removed it and won't put it back on.
It pulls on his skin and chest hair, and having a plastic box stuck on his chest makes it impossible to sleep in a comfortable position. Has anyone here used one of these? Do you have any advice? I worry that failing to have this information will compromise the doctor's ability to diagnose a potentially dangerous problem.

I went to doctor a month ago because I was feeling heartburn (kinda, not super strong but a burning sensation in my diaphragm area), sore throat, constant excessive burping, heart palpitations and very anxious feeling especially after eating.

Doctor said I most likely have stress related GERD and have me PPI and Gaviscon.

After 3-4 weeks little by little the symptoms got easier. Then I had to stop the PPI as doctor said I shouldnt eat them all the time.

Now some symptoms are back but one symptom is a bit weird: I have this moderate sharp pain in the middle of my stomach. In an area of small fist approximately. 

Its not burning. Its just this clear pain around diaphragm/ upper stomach.

Then I still have sore throat constantly and a bad taste in my mouth. A few days of constant palpitations also and insomnia. I am most likely burned out of stress but it does not help that I keep imagining that I have some stomach cancer

266,rgfbj5,t5_2s1h9,"Just checking I'm doing the right thing for Epileptic person.
Hi all! Long time lister, first time caller. 

I care for someone with frontal lobe epilepsy with secondary generalisation. They've had 5 seizures in total since July and currently take 1000mg of Keppra and self medicate with a little cannabis to ease side effects. 24, male, healthy, no other issues. We think the seizures are blood sugar related so he has a good diet and makes sure he eats enough. 

Yesterday, my person had a sickness and diarrhea bug and was very poorly for most of yesterday, throwing up almost every 20 minutes for hours and as a result, didn't take their Keppra as they couldn't injest food and didn't want to throw it back up again. I did my best to keep sugar levels up with sugary juice drinks and made sure they had plenty of water. They did manage a little bit of soup and bread, but not enough for a day's worth of food.

Today, they're feeling much better and have eaten plenty but around 16:00pm suffered their 5th tonic clonic seizure for around 3 minutes. They're okay, resting in bed and recovering but I had a few questions which I was hoping you could help me with:

1. Taking Keppra after a seizure, how long should someone wait before taking it if they have a seizure but are due a dose? Is there a recommended or is it just as soon as possible? Also, do we have any other general rules of thumb when it comes to paracetamol or other over the counter pain medication and mixing with Keppra after a seizure? 

2. I'm assuming that because this was a bug, the low blood sugar, fever and lack of medication yesterday and I'm guessing because they've now eaten, their blood sugar has spiked and it's triggered the reaction as such. Would I be accurate in thinking this? It seems relatively conclusive too me but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something which could also be a factor. They were very warm so I'd argue it could have been fever related too.

3. Sleep after a seizure: are there any rules? I've let them rest in bed since and they dropped off about 90 minutes after recovering so were well back to being conscious and cohesive but I wondered if maybe we should wait for longer in the future before going to sleep afterwards? 

4. What's the best thing for tongue bites? My person bites the same place every time and it's very sore for a few days afterwards. Do you have any advice that could make that a little more pleasant whilst it's healing? 

5. Tummy pain. My person always ends up with a very sore tummy afterwards. They are sometimes sick but not always. Is this normal and is there anything we can do to sooth this?

Thank you for reading, I'll appreciate any advice you have to offer. I just want to make sure my person is getting the best care from me as possible. It's shitty when they've gone from being fit as a fiddle to Epileptic and he's understandably scared. I just want to do anything I can to make this process easier. That is absolutely my goal here.

Fairly recent diagnosis, DMT started day after Christmas... and just did a 3 day round of 1.5g solumedrol (no oral taper) a week ago due to a handful of new symptoms including vision issues and what the doc thinks is Lhermittes.  
First L experience was from a cough - shocked my entire upper body so bad it made me cry. Started between my shoulder blades and quickly radiated throughout my torso, down to my waist, up to the base of my skull, and down to my fingertips. 




Throughout the last month, it's been varying degrees. Sometimes just a light buzz, sometimes I feel like I've stuck my finger in a light socket. Happens when I cough, clear my throat,  or take a fast deep breath or exhale hard.
Now today... a week after steroid infusions were done, the damn electric shocks are full body. I feel it everywhere except my head when I cough, clear my throat, or breathe sharply.




Am I losing my mind? I almost wish I was imagining this. It only lasts a few seconds but those few seconds really suck. I've gotten to the point where I'm really trying to keep my breathing light and I'm scared to cough. (The cough started with the DMT... doc doesn't know why.)

Popped in Colchicine & Ibuprofen as soon as I got home but surely by Thursday I was feeling some pretty severe pain and discomfort around my ankle. This morning I felt it getting better and had some more movement.  So I was just trying to massage the area a little bit to get some more movement when suddenly I felt a major crack around the ankle as if I almost dislocated it.

295,syhulk,t5_2saq9,"Do any of you get these random ""zap"" waves of lightheadedness when doing virtually nothing?
I get them when sitting in my computer chair doing nothing but typing or watching something on the screen. Or I could simply move one arm a little distance to reach for the mouse or one leg just to move it over a bit and I get this ""zap"" lightheadedness that hits briefly and is worse than the normal 24/7 lightheadedness that I get. It's like a half of a second of pure syncope like I'm going to faint, but immediately goes back to just lightheaded again after the quick arm or leg move. It doesn't always happen, either. Just certain times. Sometimes it will feel like my head, even though I'm just sitting straight looking at the screen, is sort of ""moving"" backward and forward a little bit with my heartbeat. Other times, odd 'pulling' sensations like the arteries on each side of my neck a being 'pulled' on. I do have a segmental and somatic dysfunction of the cervical region in addition to my POTS/dysautonomia diagnosis, so maybe that is related to it. My ears also both ring at times, whether standing, sitting or lying down. Not sure if that's my bp going up and down or what.

My heart rate can get up to 150-160 when exercising, but I don't get the rapid heart rate like a lot of people with POTS mention. There have been times when it was 125 resting here and there, but usually it might be around 80-100 resting. My pulse seems to increase more when standing (but not a ridiculous amount - typically not over 100) and bp seems to go up sometimes when I lie down at night to sleep and other times it seems like it goes up when I stand up in the morning.

Hoping to get more testing and rule out Ehler Danlos, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, Sjogrens (don't like the idea of a chunk of the inside of my lip taken out to examine the saliva gland) and a number of other issues. I get a lot spasms sometimes in my abdomen (they feel like that 'good' feeling when you're having a stretch, but in the abdomen area) and also like that area is full of adrenaline. Sometimes I get 5-10 rapid-fire spasms of my diaphragm. It makes me concerned for a second or two because it feels like I'm out of breath and can't breathe well for that 1-2 seconds, then back to normal. I doubt that my O2 even dops at all, it's probably just that uneasy feeling of the diaphragm.","Do any of you get these random ""zap"" waves of lightheadedness when doing virtually nothing?

He keeps saying he is a victim and everything is all my fault. During the worst of it, he accused me of being a sociopath and yelling and screaming at me to confront my family for following him. He threatened my family. He was hospitalized about two weeks ago for a few days. He is much much calmer since then. But he persists in calling me emotionally abusive. I'm trying to give him space, staying in different rooms. We have kids together though so I don't feel comfortable leaving the house entirely with him and the kids alone. 
This isn't like him at all. Normally he is easy going and kind. The psychiatrist says it was cannabis induced psychosis plus depression. 
Any advice on how to engage him? When he calls me abusive, I say I disagree but don't push it. I tried talking to him about normal things. Sometimes that works and other times he just glares at me with angry eyes. I want my partner back. I want to help him.","Wife trying to help psychotic husband

Hi everyone I hope you are all doing well. My wife was recently diagnosed with RRMS. She had an extended period of pins and needles in her legs 8 or 9 years ago, then nothing until 2019 when she had lhermitte's sign and went numb from the waist down. Since has recovered fully and aside from some mild neuralgia and back muscle pain is perfectly healthy.

Since diagnosis she has been doing lots of research and consuming all sorts of information about MS and treatments etc. She was due to start Gilenya this month but has now decided to take a 'holistic' approach with diet primarily based on the Wahls Protocol, and not take any medication other than supplements like Vitamin D etc.

I don't really agree with her approach but it's her body and I'll support her 110% in whatever she wants to do, but I have to admit that I'm worried. Her argument is she's had it for almost 10 years with little impact on her life and not looking after her diet, so she wants to try this approach before medication. I'm worried that it's risky and she could end up with preventable damage.

I was hoping that people here might have similar experiences or some knowledge that they could share to either put my mind at rest, or could share some knowledge I can share with her to try change her mind? I'm a bit lost with this at the moment.","The 'holistic' approach to MS
Hi everyone I hope you are all doing well. My wife was recently diagnosed with RRMS. She had an extended period of pins and needles in her legs 8 or 9 years ago, then nothing until 2019 when she had lhermitte's sign and went numb from the waist down. Since has recovered fully and aside from some mild neuralgia and back muscle pain is perfectly healthy.

Sorry, its a long one. Hopefully someone can relate.

So my problems started about 10 years ago as a teen. Around freshman year of high school, I started having pretty consistent diarrhea. I bring it up to the doctor, they say its probably IBS without testing me and send me off.

I woke up one morning with the EXTREME urge to poop, like I was going to have diarrhea and had extreme nausea. I get up to use the restroom and all of a sudden I start having shallow breathing, and then cant breathe. My heart rate simultaneously goes through the roof and I started shaking because I felt cold and I am in EXTREME, sharp pain. Its pain like Im being stabbed in the stomach. I started passing out and my mom comes over and she said I looked green, and all the color drained from my face. My mom is about to call an ambulance, but just like that, it stops after about 5 minutes. Because many adults in my life have failed me, my mom did not take me to the ER since I was completely fine after, and a follow up with a doctor says I had whats called a vasovagal attack and ignores anything else I had to say because my blood work was fine.

Ive had one or two of these attacks every year for the last 10 years. Almost always the same: I wake up, usually very early in the morning or the middle of the night , always starting with stomach pain, nausea, and the urge to poop. I had been to a few more doctors and all of them just said that sounds like IBS, just watch what you eat and thats it. I can usually feel them coming on and try to breathe through it so I dont have a full-blown attack and if I am able to use the bathroom, that helps it pass sometimes.

Last June, I woke up at 3 am not being able to breathe. Same symptoms as the others, but this time it was much worse with my heart was beating out of my chest. I was gasping for air and in excruciating stomach pain and I was lying there, just like Im going to die. My fiancé calls and ambulance and I remember blacking out. He said he turned me on my side and I threw up. Shortly, I came-to and remember it just suddenly stopped. I was just really tired afterwards.

When the ambulance got there, all they could tell was that my heart rate was really elevated. I still went to the ER and had two more mini attacks to which I was ignored. When they finally see me, they only do a chest X-ray and they dont find any heart or lung damage, so they send me on my way. My chest takes about a month to recover. Sharp pain when I bend over and it just felt bruised. I start having these attacks almost daily, just more mild versions. 

Ive since seen at least 5 separate doctors and am seeing a GI specialist. Ive been to the ER multiple times for these attacks, only for them to say Im having a panic attack since my blood work is fine except for maybe low iron or potassium. My GI discovered I had h.pylori, gastritis, very mild diverticulosis, and IBS. I have since eradicated the h. Pylori, but am still having issues. Ive done multiple CTs, endo and colonoscopy, heart monitor, echo, EKGs, the works. I have 0 answers other than the IBS, gastritis, and h. Pylori. I am on a very strict diet because of my gastritis. No sugar, no fats, no dairy, no spice, no rice (doesnt sit well with me). I still have stool issues, very pillowy, yellowish, but mostly semi-solid since eradicating the h. Pylori. My attacks have been less frequent an more mild since treating the h. Pylori as well.

My GI put me on amitriptyline and it helps, but mostly with pain and not the diarrhea.

Does anyone else have similar IBS attacks? Does this even sound like IBS? My current doctors are stumped and Id rather not die.","At a loss

Hey guys not on any gout medication.

Im 35, noticed I have gout in my right big toe 3-4 times a year, particularly in the winter since my mid twenties. Like an idiot I never really had it diagnosed.

The current one, over the last couple of days have been hell. I never felt pain like it. My body is shivering in bed and I somehow managed to sleep through the pain. It seems managable in the day though.

I jumped on keto and noticed that it helped with reducing the amount of attacks I suffered. That coupled with apple cider vinegar, lemon juice and honey with boiled water everyday.

I ordered some tumeric gout tablets from Amazon and only just taken them. Hoping they'll take off the edge. My otc pain killer is fast acting ibuprofen and Ibuprofen targeted gel rub but they don't seem to help much.

When this episode is over, can I get gout meds from my doctor in advance, ready for my next flare up? Negate when it happens, personal circumstances make it extremely difficult to go see a doc.

When I was 18 I had my first serious relationship. At this time my epilepsy was. Somewhat under control and I was going to college. Everything was cool. During finals week I was heavily sleep deprived and my significant other at the time could tell I was stressed. Mainly because I was uninterested in intimacy during that time. At the end of that stressful week and everything was going back to normal. I had a gnarly seizure while I was spe ding the night at my significant others house. The situation was whack to say the least. Ambulance came, hospital was fun as usual and all that fun stuff. Sadly after the incident our relationship started to deteriorate. After mutually agreeing to separate, I asked them if it had anything to do with that incident. It did, they did not like seeing me in that state even though I was open with them about it. Seeing a loved one in a tough spot can somewhat scar someone.

I was fine with it. I would never put someone through that if they were unable to handle it. It also taught me a lot.

I don't know how to move forward at this point.  It's like I've been forced off a track of things which are positive and healthy and my only options to manage the loneliness and sadness are self-destructive in and of themselves.  

I want to still feel alive and be somehow engaged in the world.  I want to recover something of my old self and feel self-worth again.  I want to spend whatever broken years I have left growing into a better person and doing something that matters.  

I kinow this question is probably beyond the scope of this sub but I don't know where else to ask.  Who else understands the extent of how IBS can shatter your life, sap your confidence, make you lose interest in the world around you?  Who else knows better the way it slowly erodes your identity and redefines you as a chronically-ill shut-in with socially-disastrous symptoms?  

Sometimes I think the only answer left to me is just to cut myself off from everything, like go into a kind of intentional solitary zombie mode where I don't feel anything, don't want anything, don't aspire to be anything anymore.  I'm really at a loss and I'm scared no matter which way I turn I'm going to continue in this decline.","IBS has driven me away from healthy activities in my life and I don't know what to do anymore

Hi everyone - one of my kids just tested positive for Covid so assuming I will as well in the next few days. I contacted my PCP and neuro who said that as soon as I test positive they would recommend getting me on Paxlovid as long as we can find it (vs monoclonal antibody infusions, as apparently those are not working quite as effectively against Omicron). Ive been doing my research on the drug but am curious if anyone has taken it yet. What was your experience? The worst side effect she mentioned was like a battery acid taste in your mouth for the entire 5-day regimen. Sounds gross but doable. 

Thanks in advance for any insight.","Anyone take Paxlovid?

In recent months, I've switched to a brand new department in my organization that is permanently WFH (big win). The union piece has been weird. I've been moved temporarily to a new union but Feb 1 when my permanent status takes effect, I return to my original union and that anchors my position to my house so I'm protected by driving expectations, if they decide this team goes by the wayside, my relocation to office goes back to my former office, etc etc. Its a good thing.

But I went and refilled 7 prescriptions today. My medical benefits plan didn't change providers but it changed administratively because I paid ZERO dollars for any prescriptions today. I'm just going to accept this brief blessing and be prepared that it will revert back soon enough. For the record, the benefit costs a bit more on my pay and stuff right now but shit, it is nice.

I was probably more surprised than she was that I started crying. I was definitely a bit anxious about having the LP done, but I dont have any fear of needles and read up enough on the procedure that I knew at worst it would just be uncomfortable. So idk I wasn't crying cause I was scared, I think I was just really really overwhelmed. 

I've (25F UK) been chasing a diagnosis for about a year now with my doctors being pretty certain I have MS with the lumbar puncture being my final test to be sure. And I've actually gotten pretty good at just ignoring it all and trying not to think about anything until I have an answer 100% and I could start treatment. 

So I think something like the lumbar puncture was a bit of a rude awakening on how real this all is and crying was a bit of a means to relieve a lot of my pent up emotions I guess. Especially since I spend so much energy being upbeat around my loved ones so they dont also have to worry about my mental space.

It was definitely embarrassing lol, but ngl a little therapeutic too. I think I'll consider speaking to a professional once I do have a diagnosis.

For about 3 years now Ive been dealing with some gut-related issues, but by far the most weird one is the fact that my stool is accompanied with a lot of mucus (like half a cup or 100 ml a day). Sometimes when I feel the urge to go for number two, the only thing that comes out is the mucus and I even have mucus coming out of my ass while going about my day. The latter results in a lot of shame for me and makes it hard to go outside without being anxious about it happening again; it literally feels like Im shitting myself in public. 

I also have frequent stomach & belly aches (some of them can only be relieved by laying down), heartburn, bloating and nausea (I barely ever vomit though). Besides that, my stool is inconsistent and I often feel like I have to go to the toilet, but nothing happens. The excessive pushing has caused hemmorhoids. I dont know if this is important information, but the stomach cramps during my period are unbearable as well (I have to take 8 paracetamol a day and still cant function).

I've been to a bunch of doctors and they have done a lot of bloodtests. Besides that I've had an ultrasound of my stomach, but they didn't find anything.

I have been diagnosed with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), depression and retrograde crycopharengeus dysfunction (also known as R-CPD or no-burp). The IBS diagnosis however was done before my no-burp diagnosis and my R-CPD specialist questioned whether I had both or just no-burp.   

I've had a procedure for no-burp in october 2021, but I feel like it hasn't worked because of a case of bronchitis just a week after the botox-injection (I' ll have a follow up coming month).  

Does anyone have a clue if all of this could be explained by my currents diagnosiss? Because I feel like theres something more to it. Thanks in advance!

I know this question has probably been asked a number of times before, but here's my situation (sorry for the story-mode).

My son was 2 when he had his first seizure (at the beginning of Covid).  He was able to speak, understand, definitely saw his personality coming into focus.  He was initially diagnosed with tonic/clonic and was put on Keppra.  Then came the Keppra rage (B vitamins worked wonders) along with also other seizures appearing: absence, drop, clonic only, tonic only, etc.  Our neurologist added clobazam (Onfi) which helped, but did not stop all the seizures from happening.  He was diagnosed with either MAE (Doose) or LGS, still too early to tell at this point.  The only thing for certain was that he was disappearing.  Finally, we were able to get the seizures to completely subside by going on a modified Atkins diet.  

At 3 he started school, where the state diagnosed him on the autism spectrum.  This diagnosis was helpful, as it got him a number of add'l services to help him: speech, occupational, physical, and behavioral.  We did see some progression.

Bring to get a 3 year old to maintain a strict-diet is nearly impossible, and the seizures came back in full force (some new ones too) and have started occurring during his sleep.  After 3 different hospital visits over the course of 2 months, we started him on Epidiolex (reserved for those with LGS), and added yet another medication recently (Vimpat).  While the seizures have not fully subsided, the severity is much less (shorter than a min, and at most 4-5 times in a day).  We're on day 4 with no seizures, but that may just be the honeymoon period he gets with new meds.  We're now on a low glycemic diet, and he's finally hay and eating :)

Our neurologist stated we should get a second opinion as she was out of options (she was actually our 2nd opinion), and have spoken to another neurologist who will be seeing him w/in the next few months.  She mentioned VNS as a possible direction to go, but won't truly know until after more tests.

Throughout all of this (2 years come Jan), we have lost our son.  I know we have to keep on trying, and we do 10000%, but it is hard.  I had hoped we only lost him for a little bit, but that kind of thinking gets further and further away from me as time passes.

So, thanks for listening.  As for my question...I always wondered whether all the medication may be muddling his mind, and maybe there's hope that if we can FINALLY stop the seizures, or get them under control somehow, maybe he's not autistic?  I don't know if I'm just deluding myself for some kind of good news that will never happen.","Epilepsy and autism and just a general rant to get this off my chest

Our neurologist stated we should get a second opinion as she was out of options (she was actually our 2nd opinion), and have spoken to another neurologist who will be seeing him w/in the next few months.  She mentioned VNS as a possible direction to go, but won't truly know until after more tests.

Throughout all of this (2 years come Jan), we have lost our son.  I know we have to keep on trying, and we do 10000%, but it is hard.  I had hoped we only lost him for a little bit, but that kind of thinking gets further and further away from me as time passes.

So, thanks for listening.  As for my question...I always wondered whether all the medication may be muddling his mind, and maybe there's hope that if we can FINALLY stop the seizures, or get them under control somehow, maybe he's not autistic?  I don't know if I'm just deluding myself for some kind of good news that will never happen."
351,sfj5h4,t5_2tyg2,"How a psychotic episode can drive you to suicide?
Hi I dont know if this is the correct platform to do it and apologies in advance for my english.

I dont experiment episodes or any kind.  Im here to ask and find understanding direct from people than from google. 
My best friend kill him self due to a psychotic breakdown. He didnt have ANY signs of mental health problems and he wasnt under treatment. Although his sister was having episodes since a few years prior to this. Is this related? 

My questions in order to understand what happened is how can sudden episode lead you to suicide? Is it possible that it was actually sudden? Im 99% that he had no backgrounds of symptoms . But sometimes I doubt he could have hidden them but as well we were a lot time together and I have never noticed anything. As well he had a full functional routine , full time job, gym, drama clases etc. 

The night this happened ( a few years ago) it was Friday afternoon , we were together at a family gathering and after that we went to a bar but i was to tired to continue the night. So he decided to go to his flat (lived alone ) and 12hs later I found out this. The police found low amounts of drugs ( thing I knew since occasionally we used to do some together but nothing hardcore, not even close to intense). 
Can someone help me here to connect the dots and t help me to understand how a psychotic breakdown works?

Thanks in advance

Just a word of advice.  Get good supportive hiking shoes with stiff soles to protect your foot to reduce any chances of flares.

Ive had two courses of orals and two lots of IVs (one inpatient, one home) in 6 months! Ive never been this reliant on antibiotics and Im finding that Im struggling to recover properly afterwards.

Hey guys, so its been a few months now since my first gout attack. Those who replied to that post were extremely helpful so Im turning to yall again. So a couple days ago I started feeling some discomfort in my foot and so as per my doctors recommendation, I took an Aleve which helped throughout the day. The next morning, however, the pain had returned. Granted not as bad as before but still not great. So another Aleve, relief and then sleep. Today I woke up and the same thing. So I figure now that the Aleve didnt really get rid of the crystals at all it just alleviated the pain. Earlier this evening I picked up a prescription of Colchicine and my rheumatologist told me its good to use when I first feel the flare up happening. So would the Colchicine not do me any good now that its been a few days into the attack? Should I stick to the Aleve to keep the pain off?

Hi! My GERD story started with gastroenteritis almost 2 months ago. After eating something not good for me (I remember it was a prepared meal I unfrozened) and felt bad after it. Just had diarrhea, vomiting and heartburn for 2 weeks (no reflux) and decided to go to the doctor where he told me I had a gastritis and gave me PPI and anti-diarrhea.

After taking the PPI (esomeprazole) I had this feeling of nausea everyday but no more heartburn. I also had the sensation of water stuck in my throat when I drink. I thought that was a secondary effect (I read it, nausea) and just thought when I stop PPI this would stop. I stopped PPI the first month but felt a big rebound effect the following night, I felt my esophagus totally burning for almost 7 days and took PPI again for a month.

But this feeling of nausea and water stuck didnt stop and now always feeling this thing in my throat. I had endoscopy which was not alarming: just a bad position of cardia (the thing between stomach and esophagus), no helicobacter pylori. Why now when I lay down and try to sleep I feel this liquid in my esophagus and this weird sensation in my throat? Like everyday, 1 or 2 hours after my meal I start to feel this liquid going up. PPI seems not to work on this feeling. Just few heartburns now but this feeling is here everyday and I dont know what to do to stop it.

It seems to get better when I dont drink coffee but not sure. I stopped smoking 6 months ago (way before feeling these weird symptoms). I tried now to stop lactose and gluten, its been almost 2 weeks and nothing seems to change.

Do you think its GERD? In your opinion, why this happened suddenly after this gastroenteritis? Do you have same symptoms and how can I help myself?

375,ri09v3,t5_2syer,"Sticky post and protocol on this sub
I'm sad to say that I need to step back from this sub for a while. There are some dangerous practices here from specific users. The mod announcement at the top states ""It's not ok to diagnose someone"". This isn't really being followed as often, medical advice is being given, in particular **users are telling people that their doctors are wrong**. This crosses a line. If they just said something like ""perhaps consider XXX"" or ""I found that YYYY"" would at least frame this less dangerously.  

Often, statements that are not unanimously supported by research are being dictated as fact. This is all seems to be based on the Edwards AMA, which perhaps is valuable general information, is definitely being stretched and weaponized. This is one doctor's comments in a reddit thread, not a medical exam. I doubt even Dr. Edwards would encourage this. Perhaps I'm wrong, there are some dangerous doctors out there who over simplify things; I say this not to accuse Dr. Edwards specifically, I know nothing about the person or his practice.  

Anyone questioning what a few users peddle as their conventional wisdom are being treated as combative when they ask for sources, aren't swayed by quotes from the AMA, or simply try to get people here who aren't experts to frame their comments as personal opinions; i.e., to not diagnose and not give medical advice. Some are treating their personal cases as ""the norm for everyone"". Simply put, this community is dangerous and pushing new sufferers away. 

I ask the moderators to seriously think about what culture they want on this sub. The sticky shows in the past, they've had problems with people diagnosing via comments. This practice is still here in full force and left unchecked. 

Finally, if you find it combative to be asked for sources for claims, then don't make them. There is so much misinformation and to oversimplify a complex personal disease such as this one only makes fun of the honest suffers who come here for help. You're not a hero, you're not a rhumatologist, you can't apply some comments from an AMA to every situation. You have made this community more toxic by not acting with some humility, and likely have genuinely hurt real people. I'm sorry to see people treat this as their personal playground. It has driven at least this user, and possibly many others, away.","Sticky post and protocol on this sub
I'm sad to say that I need to step back from this sub for a while. There are some dangerous practices here from specific users. The mod announcement at the top states ""It's not ok to diagnose someone"". This isn't really being followed as often, medical advice is being given, in particular **users are telling people that their doctors are wrong**. This crosses a line. If they just said something like ""perhaps consider XXX"" or ""I found that YYYY"" would at least frame this less dangerously.  

Often, statements that are not unanimously supported by research are being dictated as fact. This is all seems to be based on the Edwards AMA, which perhaps is valuable general information, is definitely being stretched and weaponized. This is one doctor's comments in a reddit thread, not a medical exam. I doubt even Dr. Edwards would encourage this.

376,rz55pt,t5_2tyg2,"Thought broadcasting with tethered familiar voices
Currently fighting with the delusion that everyone within a large radius can hear my thoughts accompanied by the fact that I hear familiar voices of neighbors/ an ex who stalked me. 
 
It started about 6-8 months after this post and reading around different boards on Reddit  Ive found several others with similar experiences. At first it had started suddenly with believing I was hearing my neighbors having conversations about me ie watching through my windows and later on I had made the connection that it was a female coworker and an actual neighbor. Later came to believe that my voice was unnaturally loud and I would converse with them. This later progressed as I had switched jobs and it developed from supernaturally loud voice to everyone can hear your thoughts/telepathy which has been a debilitating delusion as I keep going back and forth arguing with the now hostile and growing number of stalkers/ neighbors. As to the dialogue conversations its mostly just trying to convince me to come over to the house I believe the voices are coming from then berating and punishment for not doing so. Ive tried reality testing by texting the people I thought I was hearing with negative results. 

The voices are still persistent and as I write this post/ look up similar experiences Im being berated for it as they continue to tell me to just come out or you know what house it is. Honestly just looking for people who have had similar experiences or any kind of help which would be greatly appreciated.","Thought broadcasting with tethered familiar voices

So I've had this dull pain in my right upper quadrant for years. It feels muscular but then sometimes it feels internal. It gets worse when im driving, and lately it's been really bad with sitting in my office chair. It hurts if I lay on my right side too long. I'm constantly worried it'll get worse or that it's my gallbladder or liver. I already had a liver biopsy, all the scans and testing you can get for pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and spleen. Yet I'm still worried. I always press on it to make sure nothing hurts inside. I do have IBS-D. My doctor told me she would bet money it was my IBS. It also radiates to my back and I do get lower right side pain as well. I've thought it could be endometriosis, muscular wall injury, crohns, or costochondritis. I guess it could just be my IBS. But can IBS pain be positional? Also has anyone else felt this type of weird pain?

*Jolie and Renault are looking forward to the upcoming fourth anniversary of their first date. Also, it is ten days to Valentines and Renault is making a reservation with a fancy restaurant and already thinks about what he will be wearing. He feels so lucky to have something like this to look forward to. They are certainly very much in love and it appears as if they will, in fact, stay this way.*

It will be four years, this year, for me as well. Four years since the diagnosis. I made a reservation for Valentines with my neurologist, to spend half the day hooked to an intravenous drip, as I have to be twice a year. When I made the appointment, I didnt even notice that they gave me February 14, but now that I think about it, I guess I do wonder what Ill be wearing. Just like Renault.

*Each day when Renault wakes up next to Jolie, she is the first thing he sees and the first thing he thinks about. He tries to think of ways to make her happy throughout the day, small things - like preparing her café au lait the way she likes it, cuddling close to her while she wakes up, going downstairs for the paper with her favourite cross-words. Today however, Jolie is somewhat grumpy and unusually rough. He doesnt know why and so he is simply extra careful throughout the day. At night, whenever he goes to bed, his last thought is of her as well. How will she feel tomorrow? The fact is: his happiness, his lightheartedness - they do depend on her mood and well-being.*

Whenever I wake up, the first thing I do is to actually feel my legs. How are they doing today? Stretching and probing, gently rubbing at sore muscles. In my mind I go through the day ahead of me and already plan: where do I need to walk, when can I get some minutes of sitting in between, where do I have to stand for some time? Will today be a good or a bad day? As with Jolie, it is not always clear to me at first but the mood of this disease shifts rather unpredictably. Each day when I go to bed, clumsily shift my legs beneath the sheets, and turn off the lights, I can not help but wonder about the next day, wonder, and hope for a good one.

*You might say Jolie is a rather demanding girlfriend. She lays claim to Renaults attention several times each day. She texts him when he is at work, when he is on his lunch-break, in the after-noon and if they ever slept apart she would unfailingly text him at night. But they dont. They do not ever sleep apart anymore. Renault loved this at first. He felt like he must be worth a lot, if Jolie - wonderful Jolie - wanted not ever to be apart. Now, he is starting to reconsider. Her demands are getting stifling and maybe even a bit frightening. These worries accompany him through his days now and of course, wherever he goes, shes never far from his mind.*

Sure, I have never been glad about the knowledge or the prospects. Consider though, that there was a time when I still had some glimmer of hope. Hope for a very mild development, hope for improvement even. Basically, hope when thinking about tomorrow. Every day when I am at work I take some medication, because the disease demands it. I take it in the lunch-break again. I take a lot before I go to sleep. And wherever I go, its neigh the only thing I can think about anymore. Because I have to concentrate so damn hard just to stumble where I want to go because I need to beware that I dont fall.

*So, while Renault might or might not take this Valentines as a good opportunity to tell Jolie about his thoughts, his fears and worries, and thus set in motion a chain of serious talks, compromises, possible approaches and so on, with the aim of molding their relationship to their mutual needs, or, failing that, end it,*

Hello everybody! Just wanted to let everyone know Im roughly 5 months out from getting my third additional dose of the Covid vaccine in August 2021, so I got my 4th dose today. This 4th shot is technically considered an actual booster since three shots is now considered to be a primary vaccine series for immunocompromised/immunosuppressed people (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html)

I scheduled my 4th dose a few weeks ago for today, so the process was pretty easy in terms of getting a shot. Vaccine demand is pretty high right now because of omicron, but its not impossible to get an appointment. I have gotten sick from pretty much every other dose of the Pfizer vaccine Ive gotten, so I expect to be run down with a fever etc. tomorrow. Its nothing Tylenol cant manage, though. Im feeling pretty much fine today other than a sore arm. 

If youre thinking about getting a 4th dose, I highly recommend it to boost your protection. Even if youre on a B cell depleter, T cell response most likely will increase again with a booster, etc. Stay safe everyone!","Got 4th Covid vaccine today

Hi all,

I have had MS for maybe 10 years and never got an attack since the first one that brought the diagnose.

I have been incredibly lucky and dont feel much, from time to time a foot that might buzz a little, some of you have probably tried that. I feel super healthy, can run 10k etc., but I feel I get sick pretty frequently during the winter season, which is pretty annoyning.

I figured it might have something to do with the fact that I do take immunosuppressive medicine (Aubagio/Teriflunomide) - I dont feel any side effects from the small pill, but what if I stopped taking it?

I know no one can tell me what will happen, maybe the medicine is the reason why I am not getting any attacks etc., but maybe some of you have been in a similar situation? Has anyone you know stopped taking medicine, what happened, and would there be any good reason to think I might get less sick during winter?

I usually get these small flu-like situations, where I feel pretty bad like something is coming up and then it pretty quickly goes away. Or a sore throat or something similar - I often get these at least 5 times during the winter season (from memory).

I guess a hybrid model could also be considered, where I simply only took the medicine for the warmest 6 months of the year? I live in Scandinavia, so weather is not great usually.

Thanks for the support from such an awesome community, would appreciate any feedback on any of this.

I did try talking to my doctor about this, he simply said ""we don't recommend this"" <-- no big surprise there to be honest :-)...



Edit: So many helpful comments warning me not to stop taking medicine, and also trying to talk to my doctor about all these minor flus I keep getting. I'll definitely listen to your advice, thanks and all the best .","Advice on considering dropping medicine

About a year ago i had a drug induced psychotic episode. Did a bunch of dumb, embarrassing and traumatizing things. I hurt my family emotionally and embarrassed them infront of their neighbors.

Iv been trying to get help for the trauma it caused for the better part of 7 months, and i haven't been able to due to my local Healthcare center being incompetent.

I genuinely don't know what to do, the stress, nightmares, anxiety and paranoia is eating me up. I don't feel myself, i feel like i go on autopilot, im just a passenger until everything crashes and i lie on my bathroom floor crying and feeling everything i havent been able to truly feel or express for weeks. It's a rinse and repeat cycle and I'm stuck.

I can't get help, no one can relate and I'm just feeling alone. 

Sorry if this was more of a rant type post but im genuinely looking for some support, if their are forums, anything that can help ease my paranoia and anxiety. I don't want to be scared of this happening again even though I'm clean of everything.","Hard finding support

Hello, 

I was wondering if anyone has had ear tophi removed, and would share that experience. How long have you been on Allo before having to get it removed? And was your tophi causing any pain or discomfort?

I have some tophi on my ear, some spots are a bit more noticeable than others. They don't really cause me any pain, but where the biggest spot is, there is some irritation if I touch it. I have been on Allo for over a year now. When undiagnosed my levels were in the 14s, but I have been under 7 for a year now that I am on Allo, and the tophi are still there. I have a teledoc with my rheumatologist next Monday, so I will ask her on what she thinks I should do about them, but I wanted to get everyone's prospective too.

Since I also can't eat fruit, it is easy for me to get dehydrated.    Porridge seems relatively okay, though.  Mostly...

If it's just a one day flight, I can just fast the entire day with no food or water, but if my flight gets canceled, it's not safe for a person to go 2 days with no food or water due to dehydration.

First of all, best of luck to all of you with this horrible disease!  F gout!

My research (scientist by profession) showed that changing my diet wouldn't make a difference, and I enjoy my meat and beer too much, so...

I've had no flairs, and been able to drink IPAs liberally, eat meat and sweets.  

This week (family in town) was the true test with 4-5 IPAs a night for a week as well as liberal barbecue meats.  After the last day of this binge, I took my reading in the morning, and it was 4.5.  

Allopurinol is definitely a wonder drug, low cost, and no side effects for 99% of people.  Amazon Pharmacy charges $5/month (1 IPA) fyi.

One thing that feels incredibly debilitating though, is when something triggers my PTSD I dont do well with loud noises, being grabbed from behind, or just surprises in general. When that happens, like today, my heart rate escalates due to the PTSD, and stays high because of POTS. It gets hard to breath, which makes me hyperventilate, which just sends my sympathetic nervous system into over drive and makes both the feeling of initial panic and my heart rate both way worse. I ended up laying on the floor of my office for 15 minutes trying to settle my breathing in order to lower my heart rate while trying to stay conscious.

Is there a better solution than just, like, making sure I dont get scared? Because right now I just feel like I look like one of the fainting goats.","PTSD and POTS, how do you handle them both?

458,rvgpe7,t5_2s1h9,"Doctors told me my first seizure was because of anxiety, turns out is was epilepsy
I had my first seizure at 22 back in November of 2020 and it was a tonic clonic seizure. I was very disoriented and confused, having no idea what was happening as my boyfriend (who was laying in bed next to me) was freaking out telling me I had a seizure. He had taken me to the closest emergency room, which from there I was transported to the hospital for an over-night stay so they could run tests on me. My boyfriend had to explain to them what happened (as I had no memory of it) and I tried to explain to them how I was feeling. They gave me an MRI and a EEG test, which both came back normal. Since I had a past of an anxiety disorder, they told me it was just anxiety and discharged me. They gave me no referral to see a neurologist, gave me no advice, and gave me no medication. Its just anxiety, youre fine and  go speak to your primary doctor is what they told me. My primary doctor also did nothing for me except threaten to take my drivers license away. Still got no help and they did not mention anything about seeing a neurologist. Over the last year, I continued to have them. My seizures would happen multiple times a week and sometimes even multiple times a day. My seizures would cause me to lose consciousness, get multiple concussions, bite the insides of my mouth, temporarily lose my sight & mobility of limbs.etc. I know everyone here understands how awful seizures are and how you feel after them. Lack of sleep, flashing lights, stressetc is what caused my seizures to flare up. Unfortunately, because they told me it was just anxiety and blew me off, I also just blew it off despite how awful it was and all the telling signs that it was something more (I feel so stupid for that) . It took almost a year until I realized I needed to go see a neurologist. The neurologist right away diagnosed me with epilepsy and was in shock from how I was treated. It makes me so angry I had to go through this, and makes me even more angry hearing from others that had similar experiences.

I am on a fun mix of Keppra and Zonegram to control my Epilepsy, I was only on Keppra until earlier this year as I was still getting breakthrough seizures every 3-9 months and so far so good with the extra pile on of chemicals.   


Any way with the fun disruption Covid has had with global supply chains and not to mention what climate change will have in the future and the ever deteriorating global political situation going on this means shipping will only continue to be an issue.   


My main problem is I am in Australia and for the past 30 odd years we have gladly sniffed the farts of neoliberal capitalism and destroyed any sovereign manufacturing capability so this means there is no real pharmaceutical industry here outside of a few niche things like I know my keppra pills for example are made in Belgium for example and I haven't been able to determine where my other ones are made as the box doesn't specify and the information online doesn't clarify from my searching at least.   


My concern is if there is say a fuel shortage, another ship going sideways down the Suez, my pants on head government pisses China off further and they actually block off shipping in retaliation or do some other aggressive trade blocking actions or some other natural disaster type calamity occurs and this stops my magic pills from coming in.   


5 years ago this would have been paranoid but this is sadly becoming too real and I am not sure what my plan B is as I am too reliant on this crap to survive. Anyone else had similar lines of thought out there in the world?","Over Thinking Potential Global Supply Issues and Medication

I havent taken steroids since I got mono 20 years ago, so while waiting for the prescription to get worked out, I scoured this sub for all things Prednisone. I got some great advice on how to deal with the awful taste (thank you!!), but also got thoroughly freaked out by some of the side effects people mentioned.

I got past the first 20 pills yesterday, expecting nasty side effects to hit me at any point. The worst I got was some exacerbated insomnia last night, which has been pretty normal during this relapse anyways, so Im not sure I can attribute it to the meds.

So my question is, for those of you who have taken Prednisone and experienced side effects, how long after your first dose did you start to experience them? I dont want to get my hopes up and think Im smooth sailing from here on out only to come crashing down today or tomorrow.

She put me on hydroxycloroquine but Ive not taken it yet. I have been breaking out on my face really badly, worse than I ever had. I know lupus can affect the skin but Ive not heard of acne, just the rashes. Google was no help when I tried to look it up. I have not changed any skin products or diet so Im very confused about why Im breaking out. I have never had the malar rash even though I am very sensitive to the sun. I do get really bad sunburns so Im always very careful. Im just wondering if anyone else has experienced this."

Hi, friends! Has anyone experienced a rash after taking plaquenil? I have been on this for only two weeks and developed a rash that spread basically all over my body. I first noticed it on my inner thigh, then it went away. So I upped my dose per doctors recommendations and after about five days on 400mg a rash started spreading pretty rapidly. Itchy, burning, could feel it in my eyeballs/ears. It coincided with some pretty stressful stuff, so its hard to tell if its a flare or a reaction to the medication. I was able to see a dermatologist today, but the rash went down so we couldnt biopsy it. Just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. Really hoping Im not allergic to plaquenil! I appreciate any help or shared experiences!","Plaquenil Rash?

I have a sore bump on the roof of my mouth, and now I see one on my gums. Maybe thats why my teeth are hurting.

495,sfoyu9,t5_2saq9,"Weird chest pain/SOB? (not looking for medical advice)
This is probably gonna be a bit vent-y. For the last maybe 3-4 days I have had chest pain, chest pressure, chest tightness, that all get worse with activity. A few days ago I went to the ER for uncontrolled tachycardia and they did IV fluids and consulted the electrophysiology team, who increased my ivabradine. 

I was in the ER yesterday for an anaphylactic allergic reaction, but they essentially gave me prednisone and sent me home. The reaction recurred later that night and I managed it with multiple antihistamines, but today I haven't had any allergic symptoms. 

I fainted while making a snack earlier totally out the blue. I was standing by the kitchen cabinet and was suddenly extremely dizzy and nauseous, then my vision blacked out entirely (not my usual tunnel vision, just complete darkness for 30 seconds and then it came back). I sat down and noticed I was having a lot of chest heaviness and tightness and pain, and was struggling to take a deep breath. After 30-40 minutes of sitting and relaxing it calmed down a bit, but keeps coming back full-force when I stand or move. 

I don't feel like it's anything dangerous because I'm not really having palpitations or uncontrolled tachycardia. It just feels like my body is refusing to work. I was just covid tested yesterday and was negative. My primary care doctor just ignores me whenever I've had similar issues in the past (though it has never been quite this bad). I'm supposed to see the nurse practitioner in his office next week, but I just wish I could find some kind of relief. I've tried box breathing, pursed lip breathing, belly breathing, etc. and none of it has worked. 

My area is also having an awful blizzard right now (getting 2+ ft of snow in 24hrs) and so even if I wanted to go to an urgent care I probably couldn't. Really tired of the strange symptoms I get that don't seem to have any real cause. Also wish the pulmonologist I was referred to had an appointment available before June.","Weird chest pain/SOB?

500,sbzin8,t5_2tyg2,"After Bad Shroom Trip, having recurring problems. Am I slipping into psychosis?
I'll try to keep it as brief as I can but here's the absolute **tl;dr**: Had a bad shroom trip, thought I'm losing my mind. Things calmed down but similar feelings and/or fear of getting back into that state of mind have come up multiple times and made me panic.

I had a bad shroom trip last summer (I've had good trips in the past). I thought I was losing my mind, it seemed like my thoughts were not my own anymore and I wasn't able to make sure I'm not controlled by some other entity. This situation made me panic profusely. So much so that I called friends for help (which I've never done in my life before this moment) and asked them to come around and make sure that I'm not going crazy. If no one would have been able to come, I would have definitely gone to a hospital. I was really unwell.

After everything calmed down, things went back to normal and I filed it under ""bad trip"" and my conclusion was ""psychedelics are too dangerous for me"" despite some good experiences in the past. I've not touched them again.

Since this experience however I've had multiple moments where I felt the fear of slipping into the same state of mind come up. While in this state of fear I'm then trying to think my way out of it. But this seems to just push me even further into it. This has caused me to experience panic-like-attacks where I started hiding under a blanket till that feeling of panic passed.

This has happened 2 times, and a few times it was close to it. I am actually terrified of it happening again.

**Questions**: Is what I'm experiencing here something we can consider to be a psychosis? Or am I ""just"" experiencing some sort of anxiety? Should I see a psychiatrist or a therapist here? Any other tips or reading material you can recommend?

(Some extra info here: I've had problems with depression since my teenage years but have been able to keep it under control since going on Wellbutrin.)","After Bad Shroom Trip, having recurring problems. Am I slipping into psychosis?

So I saw the surgeon today, and it was so helpful. He said overall, Im more a risk of over treatment than under treatment. HOWEVER, I have a patch of ectopic gastric mucosa (?) just below my upper esophageal sphincter, which produces acid. He said its possible to have acid from there, and no acid reflux. Apparently only 10% of patients he operates on have a patch like that, but 43% of those have Barretts. He says he has occasionally gone in just to ablate the patch and prevent issues. He set me up for a 96hr Bravo, and Im wondering if I should consider the ablation of the tissue. He is a reflux specialist, and unless my Bravo tells him differently than he thinks, isnt thinking surgery at this time. Thoughts? What-would-you-dos?

Edit: tried to fix the name of the patch. Haha","Esophogastric mucosa

515,sxy06a,t5_2saq9,"Anyone else have a very irregular heartbeat all the time?
I don't just mean fast - my heart rate doesn't have a regular rhythm anymore at rest (and weirdly it's more regular with I stand or when I get severely tachycardic). There isn't any consistency for more than a few beats at most. It's been like this for a few months. It's very erratic, some times more than others. It'll randomly speed up and down within a couple or several seconds. It can be 60 something for a few seconds, then something close to 100, then maybe way slower again etc. Heart rate trackers also don't work properly anymore, it's always off from manually counting. I thought something was wrong with my smartwatch until I tried with my pulse ox and got the same thing.. they always used to be spot on with manual measurements. I have a feeling this is due to not having a consistent rate. 

 I have a follow up appointment in April but my cardiologist always blames every symptom on pots, no matter if it seems completely unrelated (such as SVT-like episodes with random/sudden rate of 200+ bpm at rest that he won't address and tries to lump it in as a pots symptoms). Last cardiologist was the same way. At least this time he'll actually be able to notice when he listens to my heart rate that the rate isn't regular, but I have a feeling he'll blow it off. 

I was just wondering though if anyone else experiences this. I have a gut feeling this isn't really right, something has to be causing this..","Anyone else have a very irregular heartbeat all the time?

Hello everyone! Im 20 F and suffering from a weak esophagus and 3 cm hiatal hernia. I am receiving the toupet fundoplication tomorrow morning. Im ready to be able to eat pizza with my friends and not writhe trying to sleep later, or be able to look under my bed for something without bile leaking into my mouth. 

Ive been through lots of testing and its been determined I REALLY need this surgery. My grandmother actually had the same surgery done by the same surgeon 2 years ago and shes doing amazing, so Im hoping for good outcomes! 

I have to say, I am very nervous about recovery. I know its not good to do this but of course I looked for other peoples opinions and experiences and Ive seen people saying they got worse after surgery, or that the pain was unbearable and they werent normal for months and months afterward. Im a naturally overthinking and anxious person, so any advice or words of encouragement would be so appreciated!!!

Ill update tomorrow afterwards when I can and tell you all my experience :))

UPDATE #1: 

Hi guys! Ive been post-op I think around 8-10 hours Im not sure, but we started about 2.5 hrs late cuz of a delay with his other patient. I was told the surgery went well and everything was successful. Yay! When I woke up I was very out of it but I will warn you all, its probably different for everyone, but the pain from the gas they pump in was excruciating. Definitely a 9 on the pain scale. Its already gone down to maybe a 4, but it was the worst pain Ive ever felt for a little while there. None of the pain came from the actual surgery so thats good and bad in my opinion haha.

Its about 2 am where Im at and Ive been sleeping on and off. Ive had the tiniest bit of water and lukewarm chicken broth which was actually amazing lmao. Theyve had to give me lots of good pain meds and some nausea meds occasionally but other than that Ive been fine. Ive been up to the bathroom 3 times and it gets easier every time. However, it is a little strange to pee cuz you can feel your stomach spam a little!! (It doesnt hurt at all and you can barely feel it, its just weird!) 

I cant really bend down yet at all and I still have some dull achy pain in my shoulders but hopefully that will subside soon. Ill let you guys know any other updates I have!!!

MINI UPDATE: 
Hey guys. Woke up around 4:30 and the shoulder pain was back. 5:30 got more morphine. Morphine is nice. Still hurts like a bitch tho


**UPDATE 8/20/2022**
Hey everyone. I am so sorry I never continued updating this thread. I switched reddit accounts so I never even saw how many people were asking about my experience! Here's what I can tell you after about 8 months.

The recovery was HARD. Very very difficult, but worth it. It was about 3 months before I got back to eating completely normally, but since then I've only had 2 or 3 episodes of something getting stuck, and it usually passes within minutes, and even those 2 or 3 happened months ago. Something not a lot of people talk about with the recovery is lack of energy. It was probably a month or more before I had enough energy to not nap at all during the day, and it was about until I could eat completely normally that I had a normal amount of energy.

The pain with the recovery was pretty intense for the first week or so, then eventually subsided. The shoulder pain from the gas right after the surgery was some of the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life, but it gets a lot better once you walk it off. However, that was difficult too. It was pretty difficult to do literally anything other than lay down or sit up on pillows and sleep. I had to have help sitting up for about a week. All of this stuff from the first week, however, subsided pretty quickly as I started to be able to get back to normal life.

Since I woke up from the surgery, I haven't had a single GERD/acid reflux issue. The surgery DOES work (for most and for me), and it DOES work IMMEDIATELY. It was life changing. I didn't even know most people's stomach didn't burn painfully when they were hungry; I thought that was normal until after this surgery.

As for weight loss, I weighed about 177 when I got the surgery, and now I weigh about 130. Most of the weight loss can be attributed to this surgery and the liquid diet and eating much smaller portions because your stomach is a third smaller, however in my personal experience I also started taking a stimulant Vyvanse for my ADHD which makes me eat a LOT less and also have impulse control over my snacking. I still believe you will lose a good bit of weight just from the surgery alone no matter who you are because of the liquid diet and eating smaller portions (ESPECIALLY the smaller portions, I can hardly eat anything at one time anymore, but I am hungry more times in a day because of this).

What I want everyone to know about this surgery that not a lot of people talk about is that, in my experience, it is more of a trade-off than a fix. Yes, I haven't had a single issue with GERD since I woke up afterward, but I also have not been able to expel gas from my system or have a normal bowel movement since then either. I have been taking the absolute maximum strength Gas X and Metamucil every morning and every night since my last surgery follow up appointment because these issues never got better. If I miss one dose of either of these supplements, it will take 2 days or more to get regular again. And the supplements don't completely fix it. I also eat very very small amounts, which was nice at first cuz I needed to lose weight, but now that I'm at a healthy weight it's kinda aggravating eating such small amounts many times a day to satiate hunger, but that's probably the least significant issue I've had.

Another thing I've encountered that I haven't heard much about is sugar intolerance. I have a much harder time consuming sugar now, especially in drinks. I can't drink any drink with any more than maybe 20% of your daily value of sugar because it hurts my stomach so bad. I just turned 21 in February and I have come to terms with the fact that my drink choices are very limited due to the fact that carbonation and sugar make me sick. Simple syrup, for example, will make my stomach hurt so bad I have to go home and go to bed if I even have just a few sips. It sucks, but it's worth it to have to make some lifestyle changes to get rid of the acid reflux. I will say though, the carbonation issues have gotten less and less as time has gone on. I can even drink seltzers now (as long as they don't have lots of sugar, of course). 

I am also unable, of course, to vomit. I haven't had anything come up at all since then. It's tried a few times though, and let me tell you, it sucks! In my personal experience, the few times my body has tried to make me throw up, I've been stuck retching for up to an hour or more. It's very painful, and it will keep going for a long time. I contracted a stomach virus a few months ago and had to go to the hospital because I kept uncontrollably retching to the point I couldn't breathe and almost passed out. It was very scary, but that was only 1 time, and after that I asked for a stronger anti-nausea pill (I take Zofran now) and I have it on me AT ALL TIMES, just like my inhaler. I'd suggest if you feel at all like you might be sick, TAKE IT! Other than those few times though, the inability to throw up hasn't been much of a issue.

Oh, also as a side note, I still can't lift things that are very heavy/awkward without it hurting the site. Also the scars healed up pretty well. Still visible of course, but I'm covered in scars from being a wild child and working in a kitchen (lol) so I don't really care about them, but for anyone that does, I don't think they go away for a while.

Overall, I'm very very glad, even/especially at my young age, that I chose to have this surgery. I was in so much pain and couldn't do a lot of things normal people my age could because it hurt me so bad/made me sick. I couldn't sleep without my whole bed being propped up, I couldn't eat 4 hours before bed, I couldn't eat anything spicy or tomato without completely regretting it later, etc. It absolutely changed my life. The recovery was hell, I had to make some lifestyle changes, I still can't do some things ""normal"" people my age can do, but it's worlds better than what I was dealing with. I could immediately sleep at any elevation without it burning and choking on bile. I can eat pretty much any food I want (except for much sugar, but that's okay). I can eat right before bed if I want, I can eat spicy food all day long, I can eat Mexican, etc.! I have so much more freedom! It still does cost 1. money of course, and 2. still a little freedom. You have to be careful to take care of it well. You want it to last as long as possible, and you don't want to hurt yourself.

I'm so sorry this update didn't come out sooner. I hope this can help many many people in making a decision!!! Peace and love to all my GERD homies <3

**TL;DR: I'm very happy with my decision to go through with the surgery and most people would benefit from it I believe. However, there are many trade-offs/nuances I wish I had been more aware of. My quality of life is worlds better after this surgery and I would encourage everyone who qualifies to discuss it with your doctors and specialists, and don't be afraid of the recovery. It's so worth it!**","Getting Toupet Fundoplication tomorrow. Stories, advice, and nice messages appreciated!!!

I have been taking the absolute maximum strength Gas X and Metamucil every morning and every night since my last surgery follow up appointment because these issues never got better. If I miss one dose of either of these supplements, it will take 2 days or more to get regular again. And the supplements don't completely fix it. I also eat very very small amounts, which was nice at first cuz I needed to lose weight, but now that I'm at a healthy weight it's kinda aggravating eating such small amounts many times a day to satiate hunger, but that's probably the least significant issue I've had.

Another thing I've encountered that I haven't heard much about is sugar intolerance. I have a much harder time consuming sugar now, especially in drinks. I can't drink any drink with any more than maybe 20% of your daily value of sugar because it hurts my stomach so bad. I just turned 21 in February and I have come to terms with the fact that my drink choices are very limited due to the fact that carbonation and sugar make me sick. Simple syrup, for example, will make my stomach hurt so bad I have to go home and go to bed if I even have just a few sips. It sucks, but it's worth it to have to make some lifestyle changes to get rid of the acid reflux. I will say though, the carbonation issues have gotten less and less as time has gone on. I can even drink seltzers now (as long as they don't have lots of sugar, of course). 

I am also unable, of course, to vomit. I haven't had anything come up at all since then. It's tried a few times though, and let me tell you, it sucks! In my personal experience, the few times my body has tried to make me throw up, I've been stuck retching for up to an hour or more. It's very painful, and it will keep going for a long time. I contracted a stomach virus a few months ago and had to go to the hospital because I kept uncontrollably retching to the point I couldn't breathe and almost passed out. It was very scary, but that was only 1 time, and after that I asked for a stronger anti-nausea pill (I take Zofran now) and I have it on me AT ALL TIMES, just like my inhaler. I'd suggest if you feel at all like you might be sick, TAKE IT! Other than those few times though, the inability to throw up hasn't been much of a issue.

Oh, also as a side note, I still can't lift things that are very heavy/awkward without it hurting the site. Also the scars healed up pretty well. Still visible of course, but I'm covered in scars from being a wild child and working in a kitchen (lol) so I don't really care about them, but for anyone that does, I don't think they go away for a while.

Overall, I'm very very glad, even/especially at my young age, that I chose to have this surgery. I was in so much pain and couldn't do a lot of things normal people my age could because it hurt me so bad/made me sick. I couldn't sleep without my whole bed being propped up, I couldn't eat 4 hours before bed, I couldn't eat anything spicy or tomato without completely regretting it later, etc. It absolutely changed my life. The recovery was hell, I had to make some lifestyle changes, I still can't do some things ""normal"" people my age can do, but it's worlds better than what I was dealing with. I could immediately sleep at any elevation without it burning and choking on bile. I can eat pretty much any food I want (except for much sugar, but that's okay). I can eat right before bed if I want, I can eat spicy food all day long, I can eat Mexican, etc.! I have so much more freedom! It still does cost 1. money of course, and 2. still a little freedom. You have to be careful to take care of it well. You want it to last as long as possible, and you don't want to hurt yourself.

I'm so sorry this update didn't come out sooner. I hope this can help many many people in making a decision!!! Peace and love to all my GERD homies <3

**TL;DR: I'm very happy with my decision to go through with the surgery and most people would benefit from it I believe. However, there are many trade-offs/nuances I wish I had been more aware of. My quality of life is worlds better after this surgery and I would encourage everyone who qualifies to discuss it with your doctors and specialists, and don't be afraid of the recovery. It's so worth it!**"

525,s8p6v9,t5_2saq9,"Adderall (or medication) Fatigue anyone?
Hello!

I have POTS and ADHD; I'm being medicated for both at the same time. I love being able to function with Adderall, but I do not like that as soon as my Adderall activates, severe fatigue sets in immediately. I feel like needing a coma level nap pretty much as soon as I feel it working. I can't tell if this is just Adderall by itself doing this, or if it's because Adderall worsens my POTS. 

It noticeably worsens my POTS symptoms. Including the vision loss, the presyncope, the breathlessness, tachycardia, bounding pulse, etc... my POTS still feels worse long after the Adderall has worn off as well. On days where my bpm is *naturally* worse than normal on its own without the meds, I feel like I still don't get the kind of fatigue that Adderall gives me. This is the main reason why I'm unsure if the fatigue is coming from the worsening of POTS or if it's Adderall doing this on its own. I know fatigue *after* Adderall has worn off is normal for most people (which I also experience that post Adderall crash), I just don't think fatigue as soon as you take it is the norm for most ADHD peeps. 

Thoughts, shared experiences, or suggestions are appreciated.","Adderall (or medication) Fatigue anyone?

Before I accept IBS as a diagnosis and continue to band-aid my problems for the rest of my life, what should I have my doctor rule out? Ive already been tested for Celiac and that came back negative. Low fodmap diet only helped for a small amount of time before symptoms came back with a vengeance. 

My Dr. ordered a blood test to check for ferritin, iron, TSH, CRP along with the typical panel (CBC, sodium, eGFR, potassium, ALT), and a FIT fecal occult blood test. Waiting on results from those - but if nothing comes back positive, what else can I do?

Never had another gout attack so I figured it was a random one time deal ....Until this week.

It hit me again for only the 2nd time ever and first time in 4 years so I had forgotten how freaking painful it is.  

For a few days it was manageable as I took extra strenght tylenol, used some lidocaine cream and just walked with a limp thinking it would go away after a few days.

Well now it has gotten worse.  I cant put any pressure on it at all so pretty much cant walk.  The pain is unrelenting, just there all the time and the tylenol and cream isnt cutting it anymore.

Like I said its only the 2nd time ever for me and I have not made any changes to my diet recently so I am not sure what triggered it.

I tried to make an appointment with my doctor but they are booked solid for 3 days.  I begged snd pleaded for them to squeeze
me in because I am desperate at this point but no dice.  I called an urgent care and the girl pretty much told me that I was
more than welcome to come in but they are so slammed she cant guarantee I would be seen.

So my question is, is there anything I can eat or do to help with this attack.  Any home remedies any of you fine people would suggest?

I had my first gout attack about 10 years ago in the typical big toe. Since then, I had averaged one or two max per year for about 8 years. About two years ago, I had an episode for a few weeks that would come back after stopping steroids. I have some kidney issues and see a nephrologist regularly. I was put on allopurinol and a daily low dose of prednisone and this helped immensely. Only had maybe two attacks last couple of years.

I'm no longer on daily prednisone because of kidney disease improvement, but I still take 100mg of allopurinol.

I had a flare up on Sunday after several bad diet and lifestyle choices for a few days. It started in the bone on my right side of my right foot. Started to improve but then my big toe on my right foot went ape shit Tuesday night and I was awake all night with throbbing pain. My nephrologist recommended the 30mg dose of prednisone for 5 days which I started yesterday. Seemed a lot better last night, but I woke up today and it feels like my fucking right ankle is getting an attack.

I have a complicated situation with my kidney disease so I sort of let my nephrologist (who is really good) guide decisions on most anything. I'm starting to think it might not be a bad idea to enlist the help of a rheumatologist.

TRIGGER WARNING: mention of restrictive ED

I've been struggling with IBS for years but haven't tried seeking treatment until recently. My main reason for avoiding treatment was bc of my eating disorder (ED), which was/is highly restrictive. Most treatments for IBS involve well balanced diets and obviously that was not something I was particularity interested in. But recently i've been working really hard on my recovery and now am now in a much better place mentally to start considering IBS treatment. I have talked to my doctors, and as I'm sure many of you have also experienced, they're completely useless. It's clear that any treatment plan is going to be one that I come up with myself based off of my own research. So I started doing a ton of research and it seems like one of the biggest suggestions is trying a low FODMAP diet. I understand why this might work, and why it might even really help me, but at this point in my ED recovery I simply cannot handle cutting out or restricting certain foods. I'm comfortable introducing new foods (I've read a lot about how increasing soluble fiber can help), just not taking away. Maybe one day but not today. My question is if anyone has other ""remedies"" that I might be able to try. I've heard things like peppermint oil, probiotics, etc. can help but sadly theres just not that much info out there. Any suggestions would be immensely appreciated","IBS treatment during eating disorder recovery

556,squpex,t5_2s3g1,"New year, same s***
40M / from UK, diagnosed with severe pain-predominant IBS since I was about 17. Spent the first half of that period trying to fight it and getting nowhere, and the second half learning to live with it, where I would have bad days but overall it was manageable and I could still work and go out and do normal things.

The past year and a half it has got worse and I do not know what to do. By the time I was 30 I'd worked out a routine where I would wake up, eat some breakfast, have a coffee & cigarette and then go about 3 times and I would feel empty/relieved enough to go about my day. I came off cigarettes so continued the process with vaping, which still worked. This slowly turned into needing to go 4 times before relieved enough. Now I am vaping, going to the toilet, vaping, going to the toilet, non-stop and never seem to get to that relieved stage. I can be doing this for hours which means I'm struggling to get out of the house and do anything. I am currently signed off work for 4 weeks as I was so stressed I couldn't concentrate on my work and was breaking down in tears every day. I am trying to use this time to try and de-stress as much as possible and try some different remedies etc., although it feels like finding a needle in a haystack finding something that will suddenly work for me, especially given some things may take a few weeks or months to begin working.

**Symptoms:**

* Wake up with body feeling like it's being ripped in half
* Pain (crampy/dull - hurts more when breathing in. This pain is constant at some level. Lower abdomen so sensitive you could rest a sheet of paper on it and it would feel uncomfortable. Struggle to find any clothes with a waistband in the Goldilocks zone of tight enough to stay up but loose enough to be barely applying any pressure - pretty sure I have **visceral hypersensitivity**). Pain can also go around lower back, and rectum can feel 'full' towards end of day, after eating
* Trapped wind / Gas / Bloating
* Incomplete evacuation (always) - and soreness afterwards
* Constipation during day
* Overactive bladder (always been weak, but has got so bad over last 5 years it is now utterly miserable. Not sure if related to IBS, but frequency and urge are off the scale)
* Chronic tension headaches (back of head, since 16 years old)

**Treatments / Remedies tried** (for IBS, Headaches, Bladder and/or Depression)**:**

* Amitriptyline
* Buscopan/Simethicone
* Diazepam
* Digestive enzymes (acidophilus)
* FlucloxacillinMebeverine (Colofac)
* Fluoxetine
* Fybogel
* Nortriptyline
* Probiotics
* Propranolol
* Oxybutynin
* Senokot
* Solifenacin
* VSL3
* Aloe Vera drink
* Apple Cider Vinegar
* Chamomile, Fennel, Peppermint tea
* Charcoal tablets
* Cranberry juice
* Ginger
* Honey
* Kefir
* Kimchi
* Kombucha
* Magnesium
* Odourless garlic
* Peppermint oil
* Various vitamins & minerals

I am likely forgetting quite a few treatments, but have probably tried most recommended for IBS.

I have been in and out of the GP and numerous hospitals for 23 years now. I have had various scans, a sigmoidoscopy, tried gluten free, dairy free & FODMAP diets, food diaries kept and no patterns found.My diet is varied and quite healthy, I do not drink much alcohol and exercise regularly.

This condition has really limited who I have been able to be as a person in adulthood, which makes me really sad. I always hoped I would find something that worked, but at least I found a way to make it manageable and could still work, go on holiday and stick to most events.

However, lately it has become completely debilitating and I am struggling to live any sort of life at all.

I have had relatively high UA for ~25yrs (52 yr now), in the 4.5-5.0 range normally.  Rarely have a flare up (say once per year) and I can normally make the stiffness disappear with 50mg of prednisone (one pill, one day).  I do have some stiffness in foot joints periodically over the course of the year, but they are not disabling.

I have been on plant based diet (no meat or dairy) for 10 years.  Exercise pretty regularly but could lose about 20 pounds.  I average about 5-6 litres of water per day. My beer drinking  is limited to about once a month where I could have 6+ beer (prefer light beer) in a sitting.  This diet and beer drinking does not seem to affect my UA at all.  Never have had an outbreak even with excessive, multi day beer drinking (ie. once per year guys trip).

This all said, I have confirmed gout and some very minor signs of damage in my foot joints.  Had meeting with Rheumatologist today and she is recommending Allo because she wants my UA lower and in her opinion it is my last option.  

I am resistant to life long medication but absolutely will do if best option. The only diet changes or lifestyle changes I could try would be cutting out high fructose sugar (I consume too much), lose the 20 pounds and exercise even more (ie. daily).  For those with experience, do you think any (or all) of this would make any meaningful difference for my UA level??

My Rheumatologist is suggesting to start on a low dosage of Allo as she has seen (with people similar to me)Allo can sometimes be effective at even 100mg per day.

Any other pieces of advice/wisdom are appreciated.","Would appreciate your opinions
I have had relatively high UA for ~25yrs (52 yr now), in the 4.5-5.0 range normally.  Rarely have a flare up (say once per year) and I can normally make the stiffness disappear with 50mg of prednisone (one pill, one day).  I do have some stiffness in foot joints periodically over the course of the year, but they are not disabling.

I have been on plant based diet (no meat or dairy) for 10 years.  Exercise pretty regularly but could lose about 20 pounds.  I average about 5-6 litres of water per day. My beer drinking  is limited to about once a month where I could have 6+ beer (prefer light beer) in a sitting.  This diet and beer drinking does not seem to affect my UA at all.  Never have had an outbreak even with excessive, multi day beer drinking (ie. once per year guys trip).

This all said, I have confirmed gout and some very minor signs of damage in my foot joints.  Had meeting with Rheumatologist today and she is recommending Allo because she wants my UA lower and in her opinion it is my last option.  

I am resistant to life long medication but absolutely will do if best option. The only diet changes or lifestyle changes I could try would be cutting out high fructose sugar (I consume too much), lose the 20 pounds and exercise even more (ie. daily).  For those with experience, do you think any (or all) of this would make any meaningful difference for my UA level??

My Rheumatologist is suggesting to start on a low dosage of Allo as she has seen (with people similar to me)Allo can sometimes be effective at even 100mg per day.  Of course she will monitor monthly (maybe even bi-weekly)in the short term and will raise until effective but I am curious if any of you had success with a low doses of Allo.

569,rfqmee,t5_2s1h9,"I'm afraid to take medication (Lamotrigine)
Hi, 

I had a possible seizure in May (I dislocated my shoulder while sleeping but I was alone so nobody could see). 

I had another seizure after falling asleep in October after very stressful days. My girlfriend saw it, and I went to the neurologist and had MRI and EEG scans done. However, the MRI scan was fine and they didn't find any conclusive with my awake EEG scan. The neurologist told me that some people have only one seizure in their lives and that I probably didn't have to worry. 

Life was good until last Thursday when I had another seizure at 5 AM while sleeping. I went back to the neurologist, however, he told me that the decision to take medicine was 50/50, since my EEG was inconclusive and the MRI scan was fine. I asked him what should I do and he said he'd take the medicine for 1-2 years + some yoga + exercise + meditation and that if after 2 years I was fine, we could stop gradually the medicine. 

The problem: I'm very scared of the potential side effects, I'm very scared of messing with my body if it's not necessary. 

I don't understand why he didn't recommend we did an EEG while asleep or something similar just to make sure it's epilepsy. 

I've been trying to figure out if there's anything I could do that could help me (instead of the medicine). I know stress has been the trigger for my seizures, so I could try not to get stressed or whatever. 

I just don't know what to do. Nobody in my family has had epilepsy before. 

My GF doesn't understand me, and she says I should take it without worries. She doesn't understand why I would worry about the side effects.

Sorry for the rant. I'm probably in denial, but I don't know what I should do.

What would you do in my case?","I'm afraid to take medication (Lamotrigine)

EDIT: Weve been together for over a decade and weve lived together for half of that time. He got himself another apartment, so mentally that is very difficult for him.

I eat only canned/dry food since over a year also because I can't deal with the disinfecting and whatnot, so my S.O. graciously leaves my stuff and meds downstairs and I come pick it up later when it has sanitized. I take vitamin supplements but I'm still worried I have deficiencies.

I don't exercise because I barely have enough energy to eat.

I have recently read about the latest variant from South Africa, which could bypass current vaccines... I am about to have my third shot (immunocompromised people need 3 doses initially) and was about to finally come out of my cave, but now there's this? These variants will continue to emerge. If our country was saavy we'd close the borders again or keep mandatory quarantine for travellers. But no. They'll let this variant come in and then be like ""oH nO tHeRe iS cOmMuNitY tRaNsMiSsIoN dAmN"".

I'm not even depressed (I love my job and I keep my social contacts high and truly have the greatest S.O. and friends ever), but I'm simply *exhausted* and *mad*. I've worked throughout treatment for more than a decade to get my health back, we were finally almost getting ready to start our family, and now this whole f\*cking BS happens and jeopardizes everything.

An *ideal* day for me would be simply being with my S.O. and eating a huge fresh crunchy salad, fresh fruits and any meal he cooked, and sleeping together.  
A *perfect* day would be this, but covid does not even *exist*.

I've had cancer mind you, and I would go through chemo again if it would erase the situation we're in. At least my chemo had an ending date (which had to be extended, but still).

Kept an eye on O2 and it never seemed to go below 91% and that was only after ascending stairs. Within a minute it was back to 98 or 99. I did pop a lot of C, D, zinc, and some meds after day six I think. Week one wasn't totally horrible, about like a rough flu. That day eight or nine is when it hit hard and did not know how bad it was going to get. The second week was abhorrent. The people I got it from had it much much worse, but also are mending well.

She's vaxxed, managed to make it through little over two weeks of me being sick, but it finally got her. So that tacked more time onto not being able to get infused. So right now I'm thankful that despite all the trauma and inflammation.. Brain is all clear.. At least physically. Can't claim psychological all clear lol. Brain fog and speech problems galore!

FWIW my worst symptoms were 103F fever, bronchitis, probably a bit of pneumonia, and horrendous body aches mixed with constant exhaustion (far above normal MS driven). Kept an eye on O2 and it never seemed to go below 91% and that was only after ascending stairs. Within a minute it was back to 98 or 99. I did pop a lot of C, D, zinc, and some meds after day six I think. Week one wasn't totally horrible, about like a rough flu. That day eight or nine is when it hit hard and did not know how bad it was going to get. The second week was abhorrent. The people I got it from had it much much worse, but also are mending well.

Also prayed a lot and tried to stay positive (not that I was always successful). I hope this gives someone hope."
592,svoqw8,t5_2s23e,"Study with Twins Untangles Environmental and Genetic Influences on MS
*Summary: A study of monozygotic twins allowed researchers to discover which parts of immune dysfunction in multiple sclerosis were influenced by genetics, and which were influenced by environmental factors.*

Researchers at the University of Zurich and Munichs LMU Klinikum hospital have studied the immune system of pairs of monozygotic twins to identify the influence of the environment and of genetics in cases of multiple sclerosis. In the process, they may have discovered precursor cells of the disease-causing T cells.

**Genetic predisposition alone does not lead to MS**

Studies in recent years have clearly shown that genetic risk variants are a necessary condition for developing multiple sclerosis. Based on our study, we were able to show that about half of the composition of our immune system is determined by genetics, says Florian Ingelfinger, a Ph.D. candidate at the UZH Institute of Experimental Immunology.

In the study, the researchers recruited 61 pairs of monozygotic twins where one twin is affected by MS and the co-twin is healthy. From a genetic point of view, the twins were thus identical. Although the healthy twins also had the maximum genetic risk for MS, they showed no clinical signs of the disease, says Lisa Ann Gerdes.

**Thanks to this globally unique cohort of identical twins, the researchers were able to exclude genetic influences by comparing twins with and without multiple sclerosis.**

*We are exploring the central question of how the immune system of two genetically identical individuals leads to significant inflammation and massive nerve damage in one case, and no damage at all in the other,* explains Burkhard Becher. **Using identical twins enabled the international team of scientists to rule out the genetic influence and specifically track the immune system changes that were ultimately responsible for triggering MS in one twin.**

*Surprisingly, we found the biggest differences in the immune profiles of MS affected twins in to be in the cytokine receptors, i.e., the way immune cells communicate with one another. The cytokine network is like the language of the immune system,* says Ingelfinger.

**The researchers found that increased sensitivity to certain cytokines leads to greater activation of T cells in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis. These T cells are more likely to migrate into the central nervous system of patients and cause damage there. The identified cells were found to have the characteristics of recently activated cells, which were in the process of developing into fully functional T cells. *We may have discovered the cellular big bang of MS hereprecursor cells that give rise to disease-causing T cells,* says Becher.**

*The findings of this study are particularly valuable in comparison to previous studies of MS which do not control for genetic predisposition, says Burkhard Becher. We are thus able to find out which part of the immune dysfunction in MS is influenced by genetic components and which by environmental factors. This is of fundamental importance in understanding the development of the disease.*

i'm honestly just so tired.

i'm lucky enough to have never struggled with gaining weight, even though i am severely pancreatic insufficient, and i have no idea why. and i want to make it EXTREMELY CLEAR that i am not saying i wish i was sicker, or doing that thing people do where they're like ""you're so lucky that you can eat whatever you want""

however, i'm just really struggling with my gut health and my weight. even though i don't struggle with being underweight, my stomach still just always feels bad. like, i am always bloated, always have literal just greasy huge shits, and always just feel kinda sick to my stomach. (again, i realize so many have it much worse, but i am still just kinda struggling right now :). i haven't been able to take my enzymes for 7 year (i'm 17 btw) because of severe pill swallowing anxiety, so that's probably why i'm like this. but it still just really sucks because i'm just so tired of always feeling like i just ate 12 taco bell boxes.

in regards to my weight, i'm just having the typical teenage struggle with body image, and all that fun jazz. i am overweight, which is obviously a blessing for someone who has cf, but it still is tough to deal with as a teenager. i'm pretty sure it's also exacerbated by the fact that i still get ravenously hungry and tend to binge eat, but for whatever reason my body is still able to gain weight despite obvious malabsorption. 

anyway, idek why i made this post. i guess i just wanted to vent and see if anyone has ever felt anything similar. i don't really have close friends, and no one at school knows i have cf, so i can't even talk to acquaintances about it. and i can't talk to my family about it because they just try to make me feel guilty about not taking pills even though i want to and i genuinely have no idea how to at this point. anyway, thanks for listening if you got this far <3","just want to vent a lil (digestion issues, weight, pill taking, etc.) :)

Hi all!

We're slowly trying to get ready for a pregnancy and I have spent the last decade living under the assumption that you could take Tylenol (acetaminophen) while trying to conceive, pregnant and lactating. However, I learned today that the latest studies suggest otherwise. And I'm taking it *daily* (a small dose) to manage my pain, otherwise I can't sleep. It was either this or opioids, so I went with Tylenol. Apart from that, at the moment I take only Plaquenil. Ladies who have been pregnant with lupus, how did you manage your pain (for me, I'm talking specifically about the muscle pain and chest pain, because they're the ones interferring with my sleep)?

Propranalol gives me severe nausea/dizzyness with the addition of skin flaking / scalp itching. 

Ivabradine I had an allergic reaction to, swelling, itching, hives.

Midodrine caused some pretty bad back pain along with the same skin flaking / scalp itching as Propranalol. 

Saline infusion did nothing. I'm drinking water with hydration add-ins. Gatorade. Powerade. Vitamin Water, whatever is handy at the moment.

I go to physical therapy and have been doing the exercises at home. I just feel so out of options right now. The specialist is going to hopefully get in contact about a 4th medication to try. 

Just a little rant I guess."
621,svcpeq,t5_2s3g1,"Constant pain in the lower right abdomen
I had constant pain in the last 6 months. I've been diagnosed with IBS but, to be honest, I can't completely identify myself with the standard symptoms... 

The pain is located in the right lower abdomen. I would say is in the Illeocecal area or ascending colon. The thing about this pain is that is not completely relieved after going to the bathroom. It stays like a muted and dull pain. Like pressure. It feels like when you recuperate after surgery when the area is inflamed. This may be because of the inflammation or irritation of the bowel I presume, I can count the number of times without any type of sensation in the area.

Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night I still feel it when I'm laying on my back, but curiously is lower when I lay on my left side. It is also painful when doing exercises that compress that area.

I've tried a number of remedies with more or less success (peppermint oil, buscopan, heat...) but it is never going away and always returns. Can grow depending on my bowel activity but it goes down to a latent feeling.

I'm checking with the doctors but they insist is IBS after all tests, and I had a lot of them (CT, Rad, ultrasound, poo analysis, blood test in many ways...)

Is there anyone out there who can identify with this story? Or somebody who can help me explain this pain?  


The worst part of all this for me is the anxiety.","Constant pain in the lower right abdomen

some background : I've always experienced sleep paralysis as a child. as i grew up, it only got worse. from being choked to exploding head syndrome to feeling pressure on my organs. for the past year or two I've been diagonsed with OCD.

a week ago during a nap (mostly when most sleep paralysis occurs to me) I was covered in my blanket (including head). sleeping on my side, I open my eyes and realise that I'm having another sleep paralysis episode. but now there is something different. i look around and realise im in my aunts room that i used to visit and sleep on frequently during my childhood. however this got me excited since I thought I can lucid dream. I take a look around only to take a 2.5 second glance of a shadowy figure. I quickly turn my head back not to look at it as I Instantly realised what this figure is (sleep paralysis demon). it held my hands. prevented me from talking by choking me and said non-existant mumbling of words to me. but since I had plenty of experience with sleep paralysis I was able to overpower it by waking myself up. while waking up I find my eyes are open. I zoom out from a piece of my blanket like how a camera changes its focus while blurring. and I realize all of this was a hullicnations just from the simple shapes and colors on that small piece. fast forward today the same thing happened today. while taking a nap I keep imagining scenes and have intrusive thoughts. while picturing a seen i was imagining a little girl with her mom doing random things (don't really remember why i did this or the context) now here is how my ocd comes into play. my ocd is telling/making me imagine that girl in a scary way. like with shadow head and eyes or something like that. i struggle with my slef not to but my ocd gets the last shot. after picturing the girl how my ocd described me (or made me fear of imagining it in a more accurate way. it was not voices and i know its ocd and its intrusive thoughts not something else) i slightly/somewhat shock in fear from how imagined the girl looks. a few seconds later. i wake up in my blanket with the same scenario as before only to see that the lights that were on a few seconds ago were off. i didnt realise what was happening until I woke up. i concluded from that, that i was having the same thing execpt i fortunately didnt notice the sleep paralysis demon or didnt even come to me at the time. however when i woke up.. the lights of the room were actually on. could all of this because i am unaware of having scary intrusive thoughts before sleep/episode? who knows. I tell myself that its ok since sleep paralysis  is a pretty common phenomena and plenty of ordinary people experience it.


however what got me slightly more worried is for the past 2 days is whenever im in a dark room i keep imagining/seeing every shadow as something scary or a frigheting dark figure. like you know in the cartoons when the kids turn the lights off and see everything as a scary figure. its like that but somewhat different. i keep turning on my flashlight on those things to check what they are. could it be my subconsious having trajma from what happend earlier or something else? or Am i panicking? honestly one thing I learnt about mental disorders is to be suspicous of anything unusual to detect it at its early development for much easier cure. that's it. what do you think of this? are there any other details you want me to give out?

Hi everyone,

Just a quick question about hypertension.

After I noticed a hypertension at the doc office back in november (never really cared about it) I decided to buy a home blood pressure device in order to check it daily.

In december my daily checks returned : 135/85 in the morning and 160/95 in the evening on a daily basis. Sometimes even waking up with 160+ systolic...

I have  2 drugs for hypertension: Ramipril and Amlodipine that I take in the evening (right before bed). With the above values my docs told me to increase Amlodipine to 10mg a day. And now my figures have gone to 120/85 in the morning and 135/90ish in the evening.

I think I can't get a normal blood pressure with 17 years transplant, 17 years diabetes, 11 years chronic rejection, kidneys leaking proteins and 42 years with CF etc ..But I would be interested to know how you deal with high blood pressure and if it is a concern for you. Or maybe from what values it starts to be a concern for your team.","Hypertension

635,s1qscl,t5_2s23e,"Doctor suggesting delaying treatment?
Hi All,

I'm still relatively new here and looking to get some input on my specific situation. 27M. Last year I had an episode of numbness and tingling on my left side (arm and leg). It went away after about 4 days, but the incident kick-started a long line of tests which ended up in my MS diagnosis. I have 6-8 demyelinating brain lesions visible on MRI. All spinal MRIs were clear. I saw an MS specialist who said that only spinal lesions would cause symptoms in the extremities. This means that my MS lesions in my brain did not cause my numbness/tingling and have not caused any symptoms yet. The doctor said that because of this, treatment can be delayed, and I would be monitored every six months or so with an MRI. This is an MS specialist doctor with a reputable clinic.

Is there any merit to this approach in your view? Obviously the idea of delaying these medications is appealing, but I also know it's playing with fire. It's frustrating because in general I have always been averse to taking medication, so what this doctor said what pretty much what I wanted to hear. I don't want to be unwise and risk unneeded damage, but I also wonder if this is in fact radiologically isolated syndrome, which to my understanding *is* supposed to be monitored before treatment starts. I'm just a little stuck on this. 

Any insight or input would be much appreciated. Thank you guys.","Doctor suggesting delaying treatment?

TW S\*\*cide 

Hey guys,

I've recently learned that one of my friends has been experiencing symptoms that seem a lot like psychosis. They recently survived a s\*\*cide attempt by overdose about a month ago, and since then my friends and I have been encouraging them to seek mental health support. They told me that they had signed up for the waiting list for receiving psychiatric help, however their roommate recently told me that they actually haven't done this since they believe that they will get brain damage if they see a psychiatrist or therapist. Their roommates are the only people they've told about this belief. In addition, the roommate I talked to has also told me that my friend will send messages or say things indicating that they'll get help, but then have no recollection of ever saying such things. 

The roommate I talked to has been trying his best to support them, but he's feeling pretty overwhelmed at the moment, and is feeling traumatized about the whole situation, no less since he was the one to provide them with the medication that they overdosed on, and I think he also just doesn't really know how to deal with this kind of situation. He suggested a support hotline to them on multiple occasions, but my friend is adamant that they aren't helpful. 

Do you guys have any suggestions about how I could best support my friend? Do you guys think they're experiencing psychosis? Is trying to encourage them to seek psychiatric help the best way to go about this? If so how would I go about convincing them to do it? Will it be necessary to tell them that I suspect they have psychosis at some point? I look forward to your suggestions. 

Please let me know if I used any insensitive language when talking about this situation, and I apologize for any displays of ignorance haha. Thank you guys for hearing me out. I look forward to your suggestions.","I think my friend has psychosis, how to help them

Heyhey everyone,

I had a severe paranoid psychosis a few years with intens hallucinations.

So during my psychosis i had a very strong reaction to music, some songs brought me straight into trance. I had these eleborate conversations with imaginary friends but also amazing 3D orgasms. One time i had to stop driving cause a song on the radio made me orgasm. I drove without music after that. 

When i was home alone, i let those hallucinations run their course often because they were so freaking pleasant. I often hear about scary and threatening voices, mine were hypersexual and very friendly. I had a hard time leaving them behind. It was confusing, i didnt want to take meds because i was paranoid but also because i didnt wanna loose the good trances. Im glad i found the strength to live in reality again.

Today, im making a list of those triggersongs, ive been listening to them and slowly reminiscing about what happened. I dont wanna keep avoiding them and i am trying to take away the emotional load they have. Call it a desensitizing day.

Its been years now and just hearing the songs, my emotions are all over the place.

Will take it slow today.

So kinda weird question for anyone else likely from Canada: I got booked in for a 14 day monitoring starting November 29. I had been on a wait list for maybe 3-4 months which isn't bad. Now I know some can be COVID related for cancelations but between that EEG and January 15 I've been booked for so much. During the first 14 days I had 2 spect scans, 1 CT and then January I had my pet scan and mri. Now I got a call for the neurophysicologist test that I was told was going to take quite a while.

I'm a little nervous that out of nowhere I've been given amounts of testing that can sometimes take into a year to get done. The EEG showed I have a different type of epilepsy than first thought but it still seems crazy to me. Has anyone ever been pushed through so fast?","crazy fast testing

Ive just recently got on reddit so bear with me.

I was diagnosed at the age of 10. I wouldve been diagnosed at birth (2003) but my state didnt start doing CF birth screenings until 2004. As a child I had a constant dry cough, was underweight, and got constant lung infections. In 2013, I went to my primary physician and got an x-ray of my chest and they immediately sent me to a specialist where I later went on to get diagnosed. 

Getting diagnosed at that age made things very hard. I grew up thinking I was a healthy child and then everything changed quite literally, overnight. Ever since then, Ive always struggled with finding the motivation for doing my treatments. I never coughed anything up, and Ive rarely felt truly sick. I havent been hospitalized in about 3 years either. My parents and relatives always down played my diagnosis by saying I have a mild case of CF. That didnt help with the motivation at all. Im on Trikafta and it has made my symptoms basically unnoticeable. 


Im wondering if anyone else has had the same experience or could give me advice on how to find motivation to keep myself staying healthy.","No motivation for treatments/ Diagnosed late

Despite the fact that it is the same insurance company as before, and even says the name of the mail-order pharmacy I've been using right on the front of the insurance card, my insurance does not cover any medications through that pharmacy.

After getting the run-around between my insurance and the pharmacy, as well as 2 other pharmacies, I finally found the only one they cover for this type of medication. I've been on the phone with them every day for a week now and they still haven't filled my order. They said it takes awhile to process the copay assistance if I don't want to pay thousands of dollars.

I have been off my Mazent for 2 days now as a result. And it really sucks because I'm seeing my neuro the first week of February and he's taking me off Mayzent, so it's like I'm fighting for nothing. But I obviously don't feel safe going off of it without having another DMT lined up, considering one of the side effects of stoping Mayzent is ""severe worsening of MS.""

This is the same bs I went through every single year when I was on Copaxone. Except now I'm a SAHM to a 2 year old and I don't have the time or energy to spend hours upon hours each day trying to track down the right person to talk to at each insurance/pharmacy.

I've been on the phone with them every day for a week now and they still haven't filled my order. They said it takes awhile to process the copay assistance if I don't want to pay thousands of dollars.

I have been off my Mazent for 2 days now as a result. And it really sucks because I'm seeing my neuro the first week of February and he's taking me off Mayzent, so it's like I'm fighting for nothing. But I obviously don't feel safe going off of it without having another DMT lined up, considering one of the side effects of stoping Mayzent is ""severe worsening of MS.""

This is the same bs I went through every single year when I was on Copaxone. Except now I'm a SAHM to a 2 year old and I don't have the time or energy to spend hours upon hours each day trying to track down the right person to talk to at each insurance/pharmacy.

I really hate this country's healthcare system."

I am 23, my father has MS and I started showing signs at the age of 14, got the diagnosis at 17 and was supposed to start medication at 21. 

He had relapsing-remitting and now has the progressive type, doctors have told him there's no treatment available for his own type, only one that's experimental, so he takes nothing. 

It has been horrible to see him sick throughout childhood/teenagehood. It became hopelessness and despair when I learned I had the same BS. I was and am angry at him. I believe he shouldn't have had me. Growing up with a sick parent is traumatic enough - getting the same BS is unspeakably traumatic. I don't think he should have risked giving me this kind of life. 

Sometimes I wonder if I'm looking at my future, if all this hell I've seen is what's coming for me, too, and I think it's highly likely, because we got the same genes, I think I'll get the same stuff, that I'll be impacted the same way and- *I don't want to*. ***Please! I don't want to***. 

In all those years, I haven't met a single person with MS who's doing well. The only ones I've met are the ones I saw in hospitals, who (understandably, given they were hospitalized) weren't okay at all. This has created a mindset of pointlessness, because the reality I've seen is that even people who did stay on meds and followed through, became worse. So I fail to keep up with medication. I take it some days, then I go like, I see him, and it's like life's telling me, *remember this isn't a cure, it's pointless, you are going to suffer either way*, and then I skip meds. Sometime I start them again, then I stop again. Seeing my father damages me in ***a huge way***. And I'm seeing him daily.

I dont remember why he switched medication but the neurologist he did have had him on only one 500mg tablet a day. He was still having seizures while on this medication. We get a new neurologist and he cant for the life of him figure out why the previous one had him on only one tablet a day when apparently (we didnt know) the pill is only designed to last for 12 hours. That left him completely unprotected for half a day. I was angry. This new doctor was angry. So new tip to myself and anyone it may help out RESEARCH YOUR MEDS and your spouses!  Which brings me to my actual big question. Since taking Keppra 2x daily, my husband has gotten this itchy, burning rash all over his hands, feet, and legs. And the change of the dose in medication is the only new factor. Anyone else had this happen?? What do we do?? What other side effects of this medication should we look out for??

No one on this sub is qualified to diagnose \*any one\* with POTS over the internet. Moreover, it's obvious that the majority of the people asking this question haven't bothered to do any basic research for themselves, and don't understand the diagnostic criteria. 

It's \*completely normal\* for your heartrate to increase upon standing! It's supposed to do that! The issue is whether or not it increases by 30+ BPM within 10 minutes, and whether or not you're experiencing other relevant symptoms. 

I've seen an influx of ""Is this POTS?"" posts this week where the OP explained that they don't experience dizziness, fainting, blood-pooling or any other symptoms other than a heartrate increase, usually within the normal range. There are also a lot of other health conditions that can cause a heartrate increase, so even if one does meet the diagnostic criteria, they should still see a doctor.

I hate to say it but now I really am beginning to worry that POTS is becoming ""trendy"" and I'm not sure how it will affect those of us with POTS.

TL;DR: If you think you might have POTS please go talk to an actual doctor instead of clogging up the subreddit!

I left and ignored it since I felt completely better (dumb). The last episode before that was maybe 5 or 6 years prior.

CT scan and MRI and EEG. They gave me Ativan intravenously with the MRI and I was instantly cured!  But then they put me on 24 hr EEG overnight and had only 2 very faint ones I think because the Ativan knocked it out. Neurologist checks and no seizures on EEG.

My neurologist scheduled me for a 24 hour inpatient video EEG. I think she only did this because I have been complaining of emotional/mental side effects. I hadn't had any more auras/partials in the month before she ordered it. It was a direct response to me complaining of mental side effects of my meds. She is a neurologist, and not an Epilepsy specialist, if that matters.

They do not happen with any regularity, and no triggers that I can pin down. I guess my question is... How likely is this that it won't show anything since I only have these partials 1-2 days a month and never at the same time?

I guess I'm worried I'll be paying for an inpatient stay with no findings. In your guys opinion, would a 24 hour inpatient eeg be worth doing still? I did have a partial this morning...

They told me I was there ""god"", there ""creator"" as you'd call it. I've gotten so many tattoos of them and there life, even what they look like. I see them in my minds eye, I speak to them through my mind as well. I believe that they are actually real and in a different dimension I am my own god, I created them and the dimension through the thought power of manifestation.

Has anyone else experienced something similar?","Can anyone relate?

We met with a couples therapist where I said I couldnt tell what was real or fake, I wanted hospitalization then not now. Now I have this a bit more under controlled. Not as well but still manageable. The guy literally hit me and said Ill tell everyone you dont know what youre talking about and that you have schizophrenia.

Ended in a fight even though I said I was having S word thoughts at my new first job last week. Anyways, moral of the rant is I just was trying to get ANY freaking help in 2020 and then I came to Reddit. You know not really the spot I wanted to be and he told me to get off of here. Its clear he doesnt have my best interest, I get it but hes quite literally insane because he tries to convince my mom and family that something is wrong with me when in reality nothing is wrong he just fucks with me sincerely so hard and I have NO ONE to talk to.

  hey everyone I've never set up anything here but I'm 24 and have had CF my whole life.

 I have had Kaftrio for half a year now and my lung function has gone from 36% to almost 80.

before this I had a lot of lung bleeding I had 2 embolisms. unfortunately that did nothing and I kept on the tranexcamine. 

since the start of kaftrio I have had zero lung bleeding so I stopped the tranex after 4 months of kaftrio because I didn't dare to stop mentally.

 but last night it started again. little bit fresh about a tablespoon.

 I was just a little less anxious mentally. I had started kickboxing and was picking up fitness again like before the bleeding was so frequent. 

Now I'm already scared to go through with everything like before. I always feel like I'm going to die when it starts or it never ends.

 maybe someone here can reassure me

So, I went hyper the past 3 months since my last labs and I realized my stomach issues got worse at the peak of my hyper episode (for those who dont know, you are very lucky to not experience hyperthyroidism).

I started PPIs a month after my my hypo / lab appointment. Possibility of turning hyper at this time - I did lose a lot of weight, and continued to do so, which could have contributed to my overactive thyroid.

Went off PPIs probably, 3 weeks prior to today (I also did not follow the full course of 8 weeks Prilosec side effects sucked too much), and then randomly the week of this very intense hyper episode my symptoms came roaring back into what Ive never experienced before (I was originally diagnosed with LPR):

Gastritis

Heartburn

Abdominal pain

Regurgitation 

Acid in mouth 

And additional LPR symptoms that have faded: acid in eyes/sinuses/ears (yep sucks)

Anyone with thyroid issues experience autoimmune gastritis / GERD or is this too niche? I looked up the relationship with your thyroid, specifically when it is hyper and there seems to be a connection here with stomach issues. Go figure. 

Curious if this was the case. Went in and explained to GI and it sounds like typical acid reflux to him - note he is not a thyroid expert, though, so did not have insight into this particular phenomenonit seems to all be treated primarily the same in the GERD department, though.


Edit: hi just came back here to say that, my GERD was 10000% Hypothyroid / Hashimotos connected.  Been eating the worst trigger foods the past week and nothing adjusted my Letho dose 6 weeks ago.

762,shqhlo,t5_2syer,"Gout from an injury to toe
So about two months ago my metatarsal toe joint on my left foot started to feel achey and sore. Thinking I just overdid the joint after months of daily walks with the dog in nothing but sandals, I thought it would come right after a little while.

How wrong was I.

When the NZ lockdown finally lifted and gyms opened back up, I kinda went ham and did a whole lot of weighted exercises at the gym, which may well have aggravated the already-grumpy toe joint.

In the next couple of days, the joint became very sore, swollen, stiff and red. It got so bad that I had to get crutches to walk around. Hyperextending it was unthinkable as the joint was stiffer than Stiffy and the pain was sharper than a ""no"" to a marriage proposal.

Over the next month, I saw the physio weekly and for the first three sessions we thought that it was just a case of a very slowly-healing sprain. However by the fourth visit it had flared up again (after a period of about two weeks where it had gradually settled down, and I assumed that I was on my way to recovery). Funnily enough the night before I was a fat shit and had basically five servings of beef - which back then I didn't quite realise was rich in purine. Anyway, the joint was very sore, swollen, red/purple and hot to touch. Suspecting gout, she referred me to the doctors who then had me X-rayed, blood-tested and ultimately ultrasound. 

The X-ray result turned up nothing. Blood test results were normal (i.e., within normal levels of non-goutness). However ultrasound saw that the joint was very inflamed, and the lady thought that may toe injury had triggered gout - which apparently is very common.

Armed with this knowledge, a second doctor prescribed me 4 days of prednisone of 40mg per day, over two pills daily. He's given me some extra as backup just in case, and I am now on my 7th day and plan to stop it from tomorrow as I know I shouldn't be on it for any extended period of time.

While the the pain and stiffness has largely (say 95%) dissipated - the external symptoms (redness, slight swelling) remain - especially at night time or after the gym (which I have heavily modified to go easy on the feet).

My concern is that once I stop the prednisone, that this gout(?) will just rebound....I fear, with a vengeance. In the past week I've also modified my diet to consume less purine-rich foods, and have also taken some supplements formulated to help with uric acid levels (concentrated cherry extracts, celery seeds etc).

While I will be in touch with my doctor again tomorrow to try and figure out the next steps of this dilemma - I turn to you fellow gout-havers - especially those whose flare ups were precipitated by an injury. What was your experience, what did you do to get better, and what advice can you impart? 

Right now I just want my life back - while I'm not in pain while I've been on prednisone, I'm still weary that this will come back once I stop taking it. I would like to enjoy the simple pleasures of life - taking the dog for his daily walks, getting back to a normal gym routine, getting out and enjoying the outdoors; all of which have been put on pause as I'm fearful of injuring this joint even further and triggering another gout flare up.

I really appreciate everyone who stuck around to read this long-ass post, but I'm at my wit's end and would love some reassurance and sage advice. May prosperity abound for us gout people!

I had sinus surgery in 2018, been on Trikafta trial since around the same time. Things went well until earlier this year when I started having sinus pain again, as well as more or less constant post nasal drip (which may be the cause of 18 months of AM shortness of breath). I finally went to the CF ENT yesterday and the scope of my lower sinuses looked good but he prescribed me nasal atrovent to, unscientific description, calm down the over sensitive mucus production in my nose. Its not a short term 4-day burst like most people seem to get from my limited googling, it would be a permanent addition to my sinus routine. 

Took it last night and it worked SO fast but it also gave me a killer sinus headache and some very rapid onset nausea that took literally five hours to go away. Today the sinus pressure was so significant that when I started to cry about a stupid work thing I had to stop because it hurt so bad. And yet, I had an easier time breathing today than I have in probably 18 months. Tonight I pre dosed with ibuprofen, so no headache but I also took 8mg of Zofran and am still nauseous. 

Im going to call my doctor, of course, but if anyone else has experience with this med (especially if you had similar side effects that got better) Id like to know because I really do want to stay on it and can stick it out for a couple weeks if I have to.

Once the whole Covid outbreak started, I began to do a lot of research on what I could take in case I got it. So I kept up with studies done by the NIH and other countries on how to fight it. Zpack, ivermectin, aspirin, and several others.

But that got me curious to what other things have been studies regarding epilepsy. And there's quite a bit. Double blind studies have shown many over the counter supplements can help. Some in the list include a large amount of vitamins D, E, and B, magnesium, glucosomine, turmeric, leucine, and melatonin. 

A Google search on each one of these will pull up links to the studies. Just search for NIH, epilepsy, and the above medication, and most of them show up to half of the people in the control groups saw improvement, and placebo no change. I think one of the studies was on dogs, though. 
So if you're sick of epilepsy, then maybe throw everything you can at it, especially if it doesn't have to be prescribed. Although I read in the UK, some supplements must be prescribed, like melatonin.","Natural remedies

Long time lurker here. 29/M/Athletic. Was recently diagnosed with gout (had my knee drained 2 times so far). I think I was .8 whatever uric acid measured.

I'm currently taking Allopurinol 100mg 2x a day for 60 days. I recently had a flare up this past Sunday and I desperately needed something for my flare up. Normally it could take 2-4 weeks to get an appointment with my PCP but luckily I found out about Teladoc. The doc there prescribed me 20mg Prednisone & .6mg of Colchicine. Today is the first day of taking it and the Prednisone is definitely a game changer. Within about 2 hours, my pain was about 90% gone. I'm still being very cautious since my prescription is only 5 days and I wanna be sure my flare up is done by the time I finish Prednisone.

I'm also currently taking Vitamin C, Glucosamine Sulfate, Cherry Extract, Multivitamin, Fish Oils, drinking about 1.5 gallons of water daily and Tumeric pills.

I just wanted to make this post and update as I go for people curious on how effective Prednisone is, does the Allopurinol work etc. TBH I've been really depressed dealing with this. I'm a gym rat and not being able to just walk let alone workout has been a big hit to my mental health. I've burst into tears due to pain and suffering just from this. I'm blessed to have my GF help me these past months. And I wanna give hope to people that are in the same situation. For me, I think it's the alcohol that's triggering it.

For starters, i've had so many bad neurologists since I was diagnosed at 13.

I've been told my seizures were caused by a magnetic imbalance in the solar system. I've also been accused of faking because all my EEGs came back clean until I finally got a seizure on video to show them. Finally I was about to age out of pediatrics but I had one last doctors appointment in December of 2019, the neurologist was urging for  a MRI scan to be done in February.. and then scheduled it for the same day I had planned to have a friend come into town from out of state, the doctor swore it was just a ""Routine"" MRI and nothing unusual so I asked if it could be pushed a week, he insisted no. I put it off myself, as I was dumb but also had been fully reassured that despite my doctors urgency they weren't looking for anything specific, it was just a routine MRI. I got the MRI done later and in August of 2020 I got a call from that same neurologist who admitted they were infact looking for something and I had a brain stem glioma. But that I should be ""grateful"" because it hasnt affected my epilepsy, when I asked him why they didnt tell me thats what they were looking for he said they already knew it was there because scans from \_Five Years Ago\_ showed it but they needed a better angle to confirm before it was mentioned to me. I asked why the better angle wasnt done years ago, and he said he wasnt sure why the other doctors hadn't done it, I asked why he hadnt since he has been my doctor for two of those years and he's also supposed to go over old scans, he also had no answer. Since then my anxiety has gotten worse and i've now developed severe depression. I haven't seen another neurologist since because I keep asking my PCP to write referrals and when he does, his office staff sends me to places that are either full or dont accept my insurance. (And does the same thing for all the other referrals im waiting on for unrelated specialists) I love this doctor, he's easily the best PCP i've had in a long time but his receptionists suck.

But that I should be ""grateful"" because it hasnt affected my epilepsy, when I asked him why they didnt tell me thats what they were looking for he said they already knew it was there because scans from \_Five Years Ago\_ showed it but they needed a better angle to confirm before it was mentioned to me. I asked why the better angle wasnt done years ago, and he said he wasnt sure why the other doctors hadn't done it, I asked why he hadnt since he has been my doctor for two of those years and he's also supposed to go over old scans, he also had no answer. Since then my anxiety has gotten worse and i've now developed severe depression. I haven't seen another neurologist since because I keep asking my PCP to write referrals and when he does, his office staff sends me to places that are either full or dont accept my insurance. (And does the same thing for all the other referrals im waiting on for unrelated specialists) I love this doctor, he's easily the best PCP i've had in a long time but his receptionists suck.   


TL;DR: I've had a long history of shitty doctors, and im now struggling to get in with a new neurologist, I worry when I find one that i'll be another name on a waitlist forever despite the looming anxiety of my newly diagnosed brain tumor + epilepsy. Im swamped in stress and feel at my ropes end,  im extremely overwhelmed in medical issues and i'm not even 20 yet."

825,sj6m31,t5_2syer,"Unidentified medicine from Mexico
I have a friend who struggles with gout. He has for many years and has tried many treatments. Im sure that a lot of his problem was brought on by unhealthy lifestyle. 

He found a medicine from Mexico that helps him with the pain immediately and has been using it for a few years now. He basically needs this to function, otherwise the gout will be so bad he is bedridden in extreme pain. 

He went to the doctor recently and the they are trying to wean him off of this unknown medication. A lab to get it identified costs about $30k so thats not money he wants to spend. His doctor thinks its a steroid but no one really knows.

The part that is a real mystery for me is that he has had a very strict diet for the past three months and hasnt really lost any weight. No alcohol, no carbs or sugars except some fruit. My suspicion is this mystery medicine is preventing the weight loss. He does have diabetes but his sugar is under control just from the diet so he isnt taking diabetes meds, my first thought was the diabetes meds could be the cause of the weight not being shed but since hes not taking the diabetes meds it might be the unknown medicine from Mexico thats preventing the weight loss.


He does also take meds for high blood pressure. He also suffers kidney stones and pain, I am thinking as a side effect of the other medicine. Also his liver is in bad shape but it did improve recently evidenced by his lab tests. He has fatty liver. 


Does anyone know what kind of medicine it could be? Its unmarked pills. Has anyone here ever used a medicine that gives relief as fast as this? If anyone here is thinking to take it please dont. It doesnt solve the problem. It just kicks the can down the road.

Im not sure how to fix the issue. If he stops cold turkey he will be out for a few weeks at least in extreme pain.

841,rdot5t,t5_2qlaa,"GERD made me lose 11 pounds in 2 days. This is what happened...
Ok, so, this is going to be a long wall of text, so bare with me. Also take into account english is not my first language, so I apologize for spelling mistakes in advanced.

Last sunday I had a horrible gerd flare, woke up feeling crap, burning stomach, esophagus, throat, naseous, belching, back wash in mouth, you name it. Things got progressively worse by dinner, by that time I had already lost my appetite so, in my twisted wisdom to avoid the pain, decided that keeping meal servings as small as possible during the next week would actually benefit me. This turned to be a big mistake.

So comes monday, ate a half a banana for breakfast, a small bowl of chiken soup for supper, two cookies for dinner. I also drank like 4 liters of water that day, since it helps dillute the acid on my stomach. Do take into a account I stay rather active, my exercise routine consists of a mix of yoga, skipping rope and HIIT, for atleast 40 to 60 min each day. I fell rather good that day and slept with little annoyance. Along came tuesday, and had a small serving of natural yogurth (no added sugar) for breakfast, half a sandwich for supper, and again 2 just cookies for dinner. I went to bed feeling rather normal.

Then all hell broke loose...I literally start having nightmares non stop, just to be awaken after around 3 hours of sleep, by a massive panic attack, hands and feet sweating, heart beating like crazy, brutal hot and cold flashes. I literally thinking ""Im about to freaking die!"". I go to the mirror and splash water to my face and try to calm down. Then I feel the belching and burning coming up. I quickly down several antiacids like a maniac and the burning sensation on my face slowly fades away, but the shivering and tremors kept going, so I pace myself around the house trying to calm myself down. I put some relaxing audios, get on the bed, do some breathing exercises, and after 3 hours my panic subsides, yet my heart rate is still elevated and just cant manage to sleep, so I stayed up for the rest of the night.

So finally the sun rises and decide to breakfast with several fruit, honey, jam and every sugary thing I can get my hands on. Finally the sweaty hands, tachycardia and tremors subside. Im calmed but absolutely exhausted. I fix myself and head to my GP to explain the whole ordeal, but just before leaving the house I weight myself, and to my surprise I had lost 11 pounds!!!, which is of course is incredibly substantial for such small timeframe.  Then it hit me, I reckognize what had just happened during the night, hypoglicemia and hypovolemia, being a biomed major myself and taken several physiology courses I understand the mechanism of how this came to be.

The low blood sugar can be explained by the sudden caloric deficit when I drastically restricted my food intaked, blinded by the gerd pains, and the depletion of glucogen deposits in my muscles, due to not reducing my normal exercise habits, which on retrospective consideration I should have.The hypovolemia or sudden fall of blood pressure can be explained by me drinking 4 liters of water those two days, but with an incredibly reduced intake of sugar and salt, which of course let to dillution and  diuresis, that is, I literally urinated a lot of water from my body, which of course wasnt properly replaced with oral rehydration, that being proper ions + glucose solution.

So, anyways, went with my gp and finally got my meds changed, suspecting esophagitis and possible ulcer, I had my PPIs replaced for those of a newer generation, and placed on sucralfate and pramigel for a month. Needless to say, my gerd symptoms have reduced substanstialy. That night I sleep through out the whole night. Waking up a little crampy and sweaty, but feeling normal.

So thursday I had a regular breakfast and supper, and start feeling my heart pounding, but my resting heart frequency was normal, this eventually subsided after dinner. By that time I weighted myself again, to find, I had regained 9 pounds. The heart pounding you ask? My body adjusting to the now regained fluid volume.

Today I'm feeling fine, but of course the whole ordeal was rather scary. If I hadn't suffered from panic attacks  on the past, I would have probably lost complete control of my mind. Luckily I know when to recognize them and how to de-escalate.Let this be a Public Service Announcement of how NOT to severely restrict your diet in a sudden attempt to reduce your gerd symptoms. But if your gonna do it, at least get some good oral hydration so you don't lose as much fluids as I did in such a small timeframe. It's better to reduce food intake gradually, no matter how much your discomfort might be, and to treat the symptoms with your medication in a controlled fashion.

Take care guys.","GERD made me lose 11 pounds in 2 days. This is what happened...
Ok, so, this is going to be a long wall of text, so bare with me. Also take into account english is not my first language, so I apologize for spelling mistakes in advanced.

Last sunday I had a horrible gerd flare, woke up feeling crap, burning stomach, esophagus, throat, naseous, belching, back wash in mouth, you name it. Things got progressively worse by dinner, by that time I had already lost my appetite so, in my twisted wisdom to avoid the pain, decided that keeping meal servings as small as possible during the next week would actually benefit me. This turned to be a big mistake.

So comes monday, ate a half a banana for breakfast, a small bowl of chiken soup for supper, two cookies for dinner. I also drank like 4 liters of water that day, since it helps dillute the acid on my stomach. Do take into a account I stay rather active, my exercise routine consists of a mix of yoga, skipping rope and HIIT, for atleast 40 to 60 min each day. I fell rather good that day and slept with little annoyance. Along came tuesday, and had a small serving of natural yogurth (no added sugar) for breakfast, half a sandwich for supper, and again 2 just cookies for dinner. I went to bed feeling rather normal.

Then all hell broke loose...I literally start having nightmares non stop, just to be awaken after around 3 hours of sleep, by a massive panic attack, hands and feet sweating, heart beating like crazy, brutal hot and cold flashes. I literally thinking ""Im about to freaking die!"". I go to the mirror and splash water to my face and try to calm down. Then I feel the belching and burning coming up.

So we went to Mexico for a few days for Thanksgiving.

The night before we left, I hit my gout toe (was in remission or whatever, but has been tender off and on since my first flare in Feb 2020) hard on a box and it hurt more than it should have.  Two days later full on gout attack right big toe.

I started a new job in October, my health insurance card still has yet to arrive.  I try doing Telehealth, but because they can't prove insurance I wasn't able to.  I bitched enough that my DO got me prednisone, but because I was in Mexico I was able to get drugs cheap.  The next day I was able to get a virtual card and do the Telehealth appointment with a different doctor at the same practice.  He got me on colchicine (.6mg twice a day) for the flare and 300mg of Allo that I was supposed to wait to start but did anyway and 800mg of Ibuprofen every 8 hours.  Blood test in 3 months.

I am super excited to be on Allo.  My doctor doesn't like drugs as he's a young DO.  I lucked out with the other doctor when I said look I just want a referral to the Rheumatologist and he said we can avoid it all together. 

Something interesting to note regarding rx:  This shit was so much cheaper in Mexico.  The colchicine here in California was $300 without insurance, there it was like $5.

The next day I was able to get a virtual card and do the Telehealth appointment with a different doctor at the same practice.  He got me on colchicine (.6mg twice a day) for the flare and 300mg of Allo that I was supposed to wait to start but did anyway and 800mg of Ibuprofen every 8 hours.  Blood test in 3 months.

I am super excited to be on Allo.  My doctor doesn't like drugs as he's a young DO.  I lucked out with the other doctor when I said look I just want a referral to the Rheumatologist and he said we can avoid it all together. 

Something interesting to note regarding rx:  This shit was so much cheaper in Mexico.  The colchicine here in California was $300 without insurance, there it was like $5.

867,swkrfm,t5_2s3g1,"How to stop diarrhea without swinging into constipation?
Ya know, I wouldve said that I was IBS-C a month ago. I take Miralax daily and it helps me go just about every day. Not great and they tend to the side of too loose, but better than the alternative. 

Except that every couple of weeks, despite me going every day, all hell will break loose in my GI tract. For instance, Im used to having diarrhea when my period starts. But for like, the day before. Not the entire damn week. I have been sick with diarrhea for almost 6 days now. I feel nauseous, have no appetite, my stomach itself feels sore, etc. Ive taken Pepto to no avail. Im going to try some Heathers Tummy Tamers later. 

But, I could take Imodium. Could being the key word. Because if I take it, its going to slingshot me right back into constipation so badly Im going to need laxatives to get rid of it. Which is not something I want to do. 

So, my question is how do I stop these terrible bouts of stomach pain and diarrhea I have often for days WITHOUT Imodium? Do I just have to wait it out? Will the BRAT diet do the same thing with constipation?","How to stop diarrhea without swinging into constipation?

880,rewjev,t5_2s1h9,"Siblings w/epilepsy
Im the youngest of three, and my older brother (37) and I (32) both have adolescent onset temporal lobe epilepsy that began at 17yo. He was undiagnosed for 5 years before I was diagnosed. 

I was put on Keppra, was very quickly was well controlled, and have maintained excellent control.

My brother has never been fully controlled, but he lives in CA (a mandated reporting state) so he cant tell his doctors without the state pulling his license. He was put on Depakote first but his liver values spiked (he struggles with alcohol and substance use), so he was transitioned to Keppra. More recently, he was hospitalized for a week in NYC and weaned off Keppra and loaded on Vimpat. 

Hes done well for over a year, with fewer breakthroughs. Three days ago he had an aura, and this morning, hes had two grand mals/tonic clonics. He usually lives alone, but were all currently together for family vacation, so my sister and I are taking care of him the best we can. The moment he comes to, hes so angry with us for hovering.

When we found him seizing in bed just a few hours ago, he was on his back and completely ashen. We ran to him because we could hear him choking. Our sister, a nurse, said afterwards thats what people close to death look like.

Im the only one in the family who can understand what hes going through, who knows what its like to wake up confused with people staring at you. To beg the people around you not to call an ambulance if it ever happens because you cant afford it and you know the ER doesnt hold any hope for you. 
But Im burdened with immense survivors guilt. Hes always been my big brother, protecting me and making sure I survived and thrived. I feel so powerless to help him and so guilty that my seizures are controlled and his arent.

Im not looking for medical advice or judgement or anything. We actually are a family of medical professionals, so were not in the dark. Were just scared. Im scared.

Needless to say I have been up since gathering all the information I can, I know drs say not to worry but I ignorantly hadnt heard of CF. 

His screen test came back negative but they want to do genetic testing. I was wondering if any of you had experienced a false negative or false positive even?

His twin is showing no signs and was born nearly double the size of his suspected CF brother.

I have read some inspiring stuff on here and else where and if CF it is so be it, we will make it normal and enjoy every day. Modern medicine is amazing after all. 

Hope Ive not broken any rules, be gentle, thank you for reading and any comments are welcome.

I should note my twins are premature, 32 weeks delivery.

UPDATE:

I dont know if many will see this but its crazy to look back on.

After all my little man does not have CF. 

Thank you all for the words at the time, I have since got involved with CF chairties as even though my little one doesnt have it, awareness must be had.

I do want to out this out there for others that a meconium ileas doesnt always mean CF. 

Took us months to get the genetic testing back. 

Stoma is now reversed which involved another emergency surgery after The reversal went wrong. 

Were on the other side now hopefully. 

Thanks again for all the interaction on this post when I was at a very vulnerable time.","One of my twin boys is suspected of CF. Looking for any stories or help to prepare.

Does anyone else have this thing? I sigh multiple times a day without knowing it or thinking of anything in particular. I think my body might be doing it to regulate my breath, because I suffer from irregular breathing due to POTS. But I am not sure. I've noticed that the sighs force me to take a deep breath right after. So this is my theory. 

Is it just a me - thing or do others do the same?","Sighing a lot unconsciously

Hi everyone- Ive recently started taking Keppra at a low dose for the last 3 weeks or so- amongst other unpleasant side effects is the striking loss of appetite/ complete disinterest in food. Its quite bizzarre, and Ive lost 7kgs over 3 weeks since starting (and I am slim to begin with). 

I cant seem to tolerate proper meals, and can only really do small snacks here and there- Ive started exercising more to work up an appetite, and make it a priority to include some sort of protein source with every snack to offset the inevitable muscle wasting. It looks like a lot of other people here are in the same boat- an excellent resource that Ive found helpful is any dietary advice given to patients having chemo- small frequent high protein snacks as tolerated.

the average person would say okay well diet and workout, but dieting triggers my eating disorder and anything stronger than walking makes me black out. i decided to cut out fast food and sodas. im noticing a change, however i wont be weighing myself as i feel it would trigger me.

The pain went but it still felt stiff, tight when I tried to curl my toes ot make a fist with them but it but as it's my first attack I thought this was normal and it will soon pass.

Today (6 weeks on) the pain is back, cannot bend toes or put weight on my foot, called the docs again this morning and he has just given me Prednisolone, just taken my first dose about 10 mins ago.

Since the first doc appt I have cut out all red meat, shellfish and haven't had a single beer (had a couple of ciders but thats it) I have started taking vic c, apple cider vinegar supplements and tar cherry supplements.

I have also ordered a Uric Acid blood testing kit.

Of course, lupus specifically can cause many severe heart complications, but as someone without any urgent scares related to my heart, I was curious if other peoples stats were similar to mine.","Autoimmune folks and heart stats?
Hi all! I had a question about your heart statistics. Ive always had very low blood pressure (95/57) with a higher than average heart rate (90s). It makes physical activity very difficult and accelerates feelings of fatigue. My mother, lupus-diagnosed, has Wolf-Parkinsons White syndrome (a usually manageable form of heart arrhythmia) and Im planning on asking my doctor to test me for it.

918,sxry7v,t5_2r876,"I would love to get some inputs on whether my 14 year-old son should get the Covid 19 booster.
In the European country where we live, boosters are not available for those under 18. In the country we come from, which we are visiting right now, kids his age can get the booster. 

He was diagnosed with CF two years ago, after two episodes of acute pancreatitis. His diagnosis is atypical CF and it is mostly GI problems he deals with. He has also had a lung infection that cleared with antiobiotics and some wheezing in cold weather.

His CF clinic invited him early for the vaccine due to his condition, but there are no plans for booster since under 18s are not eligible. And the WHO is saying that people under 18 do not need the booster.

He had Covid 19 in December 2020.

We have an appointment tomorrow for him to get the booster. But now I am having second thoughts. I am curious about what others have done or what you would do in our situation.

925,rg0dqc,t5_2qlaa,"I'm nervous to start PPI
So two weeks ago I (29f) was diagnosed with costochondritis and told to take ibuprofen 3X daily for 5 days. Towards the end of the 2nd day, I developed pretty bad heartburn for a few hours, but I dismissed it thinking it was chest pain from making my costochondritis worse by carrying heavy bags. The next day I developed bad heartburn again (for ~13 hours) and again dismissed it until that night when my fiance pointed out that it might be the ibuprofen causing heartburn. I immediately stopped taking ibuprofen but have been dealing with the repercussions ever since. My entire GI was messed up for several days. I thought I'd have to go to the ER a couple of times, and the one time I took a small dose of Mylanta THAT caused the worst cramping I've ever felt in my life. It also gave me weird brain fog and chills, so I've been very nervous to take it or any other antacid again.

Overall, I've been getting better. I've been eating only alkaline foods, sipping ginger tea, sleeping upright, anything that might help naturally. Three days ago was the first day I wasn't constantly in pain, but I still have a fairly constant burning sensation in my esophagus, lots of burping, and occasional esophageal pseudo-dyspnea. I saw a doctor today and he prescribed an Omeprazole titration (20 mg 2X daily for two weeks, 1X daily for two weeks, every other day for two weeks). Then we'll go from there. Now that I know what it is, I've realized I've experienced some minor esophageal burning and pseudo-dyspnea in the past, and I may have finally pushed my body over the edge into full-on acid reflux.

I know there's probably nothing to worry about with this PPI, but I've been getting more and more medication anxious over the past couple of years. I also have Multiple Sclerosis and take steroids at least 2X year, and one thing I'm concerned about is my increased risk for osteoporosis. I'm also someone who typically does get side effects with medication, so I'm worried my body might be one of the rare unlucky ones with PPI as well.

My husband has been a gout sufferer for years, with attack frequency averaging 3-4 times per year. Due to careless primary care physicians, he was taken off allopurinol years ago and managed his flares mainly with Prednisone and colchicine. However, in the last year his gout has become particularly debilitating, striking literally every couple of weeks. He was finally seen by a good rheumatologist who put him back on 100mg of allo. That was some 2 months ago. He was prepared to experience flares while getting used to allo, but they don't seem to let go at all. Literally every time we have a few days of rainy/ humid weather, he gets a flare across multiple joints - his hands, knees, ankles...even neck! We live in the Northeast with unstable weather, so he's been ridden with severe inflammation every couple of weeks for 3-4 days. 
The rheumatologist says they need to measure his UA when he's not having a flare to see if he needs a higher dose of allo, but it seems like he's in the midst of one continuous attack!

I'm feeling really afraid and alone right now. It's 2am and I'm supposed to be sleeping. The day before I didn't sleep until 11am because I was having a panic attack about what if this could be something worse, but since then I do think it's related to my esophagus instead. My sister is in medical school and thinks I have gerd. 

I've been having symptoms for a week now and I'm confused if this is my fate... Is it considered gerd if it's been going on for only one week? I don't have anyone who can empathize to talk to about this, my dad thinks I'm overreacting and that I did this to myself. I have anxiety issues and have had health scares before (like when I had covid and insisted on going to the hospital and felt I was having trouble breathing, but my lungs were fine) and he's just done with it.

 I feel pressure behind my breast bone on the right and sometimes it feels like it goes to the left (?) .. I tried to ignore it and tried to chew my food more, because when I don't chew my food I feel as if it got caught in my chest. I took too many antacids the first day and just assumed it would go away on its own. 

First getting used to tinnitus and now this  I had really spicy food last Saturday and then last Sunday I tried my friend's soup and that night I couldn't sleep, I felt a bit of liquid escaping from my stomach and going into my mouth and it wasn't fully acidic it was pretty watered down, and since then my problems started. I haven't taken naproxen in a long time but I wonder if I damaged my body in the past from not eating enough food taking it. I didn't really experience acid reflux too much and when I did it wasn't annoying or I thought that's just normal after eating food sometimes. But I did notice for a few years my throat has been a bit raw feeling, never 100% perfect. 

 My main concern is :
Does the pressure of feeling like something is on top of your breastbone go away? And the feeling of food going down your esophagus. Should I be worried of hiatal hernia? How can I tell that I have that instead? I only had bad acid reflux that day and I don't feel it now but I keep burping, but feels a lot more like air bubbles that don't give much relief. Is there a way for my esophagus to heal from this?

Do you still have really bad IBS pain but are just high. Because if I still have peak IBS pain while being high I think that might just be too much stimulation for me and might cause a panic attack. Already the IBS pain almost puts me into a panic attack each time. 

I havent smoked in years, but for the most part I was never paranoid smoking marijuana but edibles always made me slightly paranoid and sometimes really paranoid. But Im starting to consider getting marijuana for the pain if it does indeed really help. But I dont want it to worsen my IBS."

945,r9u5lz,t5_2syer,"Breakthrough gout with low uric acid level
I have been on 300mg allopurinol for a little over a year now. My uric acid level as of last August was 4.3. Yet I still have gout flareups from time to time. My rheumatologist changed me to 400mg allo. I have colchicine for flares as well as prednisone (which works well).

What I don't understand is why, with such a low uric acid level, I get any flareups at all. When I went from 7.6 four years ago (non-medicated) to 4.3 now I thought that I should be just about immune to gout, yet still it happens.

Any thoughts on why this is?

946,su6w96,t5_2s23e,"How well are you sleep these days?
So I've been having problems sleeping. Falling asleep at the usual time is no problem, but lately I've been waking up 3-4 hours later and cannot get back to sleep without getting up and doing something mundane for a few hours. I then will wake up a few hours later to start my day and am dragging all day.

I know sleep is critical to managing MS and overall health in general, but what I want to know is how typical this is. For my fellow insomniacs, does anything help particularly well? How likely is it that a relapse is contributing to the problem? Personally I doubt a root cause can be determined, but maybe your experiences may help me narrow it down. I try to adjust my sleeping habits and setup to help mitigate and it helps for a while but nothing seems to stick. 

I look forward to reading your comments!","How well are you sleep these days?

Until a few days ago, where almost the whole top half of my body felt like the pain you feel when you experience a tight stitch in the sides of your ribs if you have been running too long. That exact feeling, just everywhere on my top half.

This came and went for a few days and has now completely vanished.

I had been doing no heavy lifting, no sports etc that would have caused this feeling, and I have never felt it before in my life. 

I supposed I could have pulled something and not known about it until after, I was just wondering if anyone that has experience an MS hug feeling would describe it the same way that I have.","MS hug question.

*- Initiation of Phase 3 program expected in the second half of 2021""*

&#x200B;

**VX-121 + TEZACAFTOR + VX-561 (Vertex next triple therapy)**

An immediate benefit to this treatment is that VX-561 is deuterated ivacaftor and would replace normal ivacaftor (Kalydeco) and **only needs to be taken once a day**. So I believe this entire next triple therapy would also only need to be taken once a day rather than Trikaftas/Kaftrios twice a day. This may also help with people who struggle to take the 10-20g of fat you are required to take with Trikafta/Kaftrio as you would just take it with a big fatty main meal (lunch or dinner).

VX-121 is supposed to be an improved version of elexacaftor.

Overall my hopes for this is an improved version Trikafta/Kaftrio with fewer side effects and you only have to take it once a day.

So I was diagnosed with Lupus in 2005 I have had any symptom and issue related to lupus and its accessories like I call it, that you can think of. I have Lupus Anticoagulant also. Every single time I get my period or ovulate I get a flare up, never fails. Swollen knee as well as pain, fever, rashes, swollen lymphnodes.. etc. Anyhow,  I started with a pain in my groin 3 days ago, right side and yesterday my right knee got swollen but my period is supposed to start today so I just brushed it off as a normal flare up. Well today my knee still kind of swollen, but my calf is swollen and my whole leg hurts, I can barely walk. My calf have never EVER gotten swollen because of a flare up. I am starting to think it could be a clot, but I dont want to stress myself out of its just a flare up. Has anyone experienced their calves getting swollen at all during a flare up? Its just such a weird part to get swollen for me. Sorry for the long post."

Ayo. Not asking for a diagnosis because I'm pretty sure I've figured out the problem, but I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced the same thing I am. Currently I'm off Trikafta and have been for a little over a week now (should be getting a new order in tomorrow, the hospital was just being incompetent lol). Yesterday I suddenly got some really intense abdominal pain. This happened once before when I went of Trikafta, as well as a few other times that may have been due to me going off of Orkambi. It only happens every few months at *most*, and I actually hadn't experienced it at ALL during 2021, so I'm pretty sure this type of pain only occurs when I go off those specific meds. Anyone else have the same thing? I tried to look into it online but I only saw stomach pain symptoms for people actively taking Trikafta (which I thankfully never experienced). Weird stuff!","Weird Trikafta stuff

982,sfttn8,t5_2s23e,"Tysabri is having an impact on my mental health, should I switch?
Hello all!

Background info:
- I'm 25F RRMS Brit, living in Europe. Diagnosed last July 2021 after what I suspect was around a year of emerging symptoms. MRI found 20+ lesions in the brain and 3 in the spine. The docs aren't sure if I was a long time untreated or just have rather aggressive attacks. Therapy settled all my complaints and I've been living (so I think) symptomless since then.

I started Tysabri in September 2021, so 5 months now. I have it administered by my neuro at their practice every 4 weeks. Scans show no changes and no active lesions so they want to keep me on it.

Okay so, I'm not doing so well with the health/life balance. The injections are unpleasant but I can deal with that; what I struggle with is the frequency of which I have to have them. I'm quite free spirited, I like to travel, I'm hoping to work nomadically, I like to move around.
I really struggle with feeling like I'm trapped. I'm depressed, caught between enjoying my life and taking care of my condition. I feel like I can't be myself while I'm tied to my neurologist like this. My thoughts are becoming intrusive and the deeper in the spiral I get the more I start to boil it down to numbers and stats. 

I'm increasingly worried about the risk of PML: The hospital MS outpatients repeatedly lost my results, information, cancelled appointments and actually failed to advise me correctly before my diagnosis (even when I had a scan that pointed to MS!) which resulted in a trip to A&E before I was admitted.
I'm terrified that they'll miss something vital and the mistake could be fatal in this delicate situation. 

Has anyone else switched medication or does anyone have Tysabri and have the same feelings/worries?","Tysabri is having an impact on my mental health, should I switch?

Mostly covers my cheeks, with a little redness on my nose and forehead, stops right at the nasolabial fold.

I said if I don't have kids and none of my siblings or cousins pass down the gene then CF could be basically deleted from the family gene pool and prevent any sick kids down the line. My mum said it sounds a bit like eugenics . 

I guess she can think what she likes. But I dont think irradicating the CF gene is an evil thing. CF is a horrible chronic disease.

1006,s5mq6r,t5_2tyg2,"How would you describe psychosis to someone who hasnt experienced it? (Based on your own history)
For me it was almost as if things were speed up (like an old vcr). Also theres this strange experience where no matter what happens in your immediate surrounding it seems like its a coded message given to you. (Example I got a note for a swimming party at my apartment and thought it meant I was being followed by police).

I also heard voices but they werent really talking to me. It was more like hearing someone in the room over.

Music was very strange too. No matter what the lyric was it felt like a deep and profound message in ways that Ive never experienced music before. (Example: thought my phone was controlled by the FBI so when I hit shuffle theyd send me a warning through the song).

As far as visual hallucinations its hard to say because I think I experienced those during my blackout memory. I do remember seeing a big vault in the hospital that wasnt there later.

Im curious if these are similar to your experiences.

(Edit: I will also say for those that have had psychedelic experiences. It is a similar except theres no real enjoyable part of the experience. When youre tripping you know youre tripping. When youre in psychosis you cant tell when it happens. Ill also say that psychedelic trips are more of a spiritual eye opening type experience whereas psychosis is more like your brain coming up with false scenarios and beliefs.

Like imagine all those fake scenarios you think of about people talking about you when youre not around. But suddenly you believe theyre real.

I also forgot to mention I had this internal sensation of falling apart literally.)

(Also the person who mentioned it feels like extreme deja vu nailed it.)","How would you describe psychosis to someone who hasnt experienced it? (Based on your own history)
For me it was almost as if things were speed up (like an old vcr). Also theres this strange experience where no matter what happens in your immediate surrounding it seems like its a coded message given to you. (Example I got a note for a swimming party at my apartment and thought it meant I was being followed by police).

I also heard voices but they werent really talking to me. It was more like hearing someone in the room over.

Music was very strange too. No matter what the lyric was it felt like a deep and profound message in ways that Ive never experienced music before. (Example: thought my phone was controlled by the FBI so when I hit shuffle theyd send me a warning through the song).

I want to start dating properly, and I know it sounds stupid but I feel selfish. How do I allow someone to love me knowing I will hurt them in the end? How do I bring children into the world knowing they might have to grow up without me? When I date, this is all I can think about. I feel insecure and push people away before anything starts. I want to start living for myself, but I think of this and become depressed. Ive tried using it as motivation but my social anxiety doesnt allow me - its so frustrating.

I know things can happen in life that makes all kinds of people lose their life young, but I KNOW this is coming for me.

1048,rpq1e2,t5_2qlaa,"Can smooth muscle twitches be related to GERD and air quality? - please help my condition is getting worse....
I have very disturbing symptoms for the last 2 months - it started with little reflux which was felt by me as heartburn and about 3 weeks later - muscle twitches in the legs, chest, arms and neck. These twitches sometimes get stronger very suddently, which makes me scared totally.

However, they only happen inside my home - the less ventilated or heated it is, the worse symptoms. 

When i go outside - these twitches slowly go away. I suspect, lower oxygen or less humidity inside my home - but can it trigger smooth muscle twitches? Sometimes i feel only reflux, sometimes only twitches, but the worst is when they both happen at the same time. 

Blood tests regarding heart, EKG, Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium, D-Dimer, X-Ray of chest, kidneys are all fine.

ALL doctors told me its 100% anxiety and panic attacks. But, when i dont have these twitches I sleep like a baby, my life is the same as 6 months ago, 1 year ago etc....

I may have ongoing stress from various issues, but I got used to it. Could it be nervous system burn out? I work a lot and have relatively little relaxation.

Can my condition originate from the GERD? When it started I ate a lot of chocolate and citrus fruits, other than that my diet is rather on a healthy side - not too much or too little of all kinds of foods...

I will be grateful for your help.","Can smooth muscle twitches be related to GERD and air quality? - please help my condition is getting worse....

1049,si3xr0,t5_2s23e,"Certain gut bacteria, and high meat consumption, may increase risks for MS, study shows
If you eat a lot of meat, you may be at increased risk for multiple sclerosis, a new study suggests.

MS is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulation around nerves. It's not clear what triggers the attack, but mounting evidence suggests bacteria plays a role. Gut bacteria can affect the immune system, and diet influences gut bacteria.

**To learn more about the interplay of diet, gut bacteria, the immune system and MS, researchers studied 25 MS patients and 24 people without the disease.**

*""We found a number of gut bacteria associated with MS and severity of disability of MS patients,""* said study author Dr. Yanjiao Zhou, an assistant professor of medicine at UConn Health School of Medicine in Farmington, Conn.

*""We also found increased autoimmune markers and signature metabolites in MS. But what is really interesting is how these systems connect with each other, and how diet is involved in these connections,""* Zhou said in a University of Connecticut news release.

***Eating more meat, having lower levels of certain bacteria in the gut, and more of certain immune cells in the blood were all associated with MS, according to the report published online recently in the journal EBioMedicine.***

**Higher meat consumption, which was found in the MS patients, was linked with lower gut levels of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron -- a bacteria involved with digesting carbohydrates from vegetables.**

Higher meat consumption was also related to an increase in T-helper 17 cells in the immune system, and an increase in S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the blood.

The researchers said the findings suggest that in people with MS, something disconnects their gut bacteria from the immune system, resulting in autoimmune attacks on the nervous system. This sequence tends to be associated with meat-eating, they suggested.

According to study author Dr. Laura Piccio, *""This is the first study using an integrated approach to analyze the interplay between diet, gut microbiome, the immune system and metabolism"" and their contribution to MS development. Piccio is an associate professor of neurology at the University of Sydney who was previously at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.*

The authors want to expand their research to include more people, including patients with a more severe form of MS. The aim is to learn more about the interaction of diet, gut bacteria and the immune system in MS to possibly prevent the disease or ease symptoms.

1051,sjvwvz,t5_2s3g1,"Need some help with diagnosis - IBS symptoms?
Hi all,

First I wanted to thank you for your time ahead of reading this post - it is going to be a long and whiny one where I really need help from all of you (the IBS experts!) in determining if what I am suffering from is IBS related. I will go in depth about my symptoms.

In mid December I started noticing a few instances where I had constipated stools - hard balls (never happened to me before!) - but not tied to any kind of pain and seemed to resolve itself. On Christmas Day, I came down with a fever of 101.5 for the day and had stomach pain that seemed linked to constipation / gas until January 2. I started to feel better until I got my booster shot (Pfizer) on January 5. After that began my personal hell. I felt lower back pain / cramping and a stabbing in my low abdomen the next day that gradually became worse until the 11th. I got my period on the 10th, so I thought maybe it was related to that - but Advils which I usually take were not working. I went into the ER on the 11th and was told it could be Endo and given Naproxen. My pain subsided a bit over the course of the next few days, just a weird feeling in my low abdomen.

A week later my pain started escalating. My doctor did an Xray and found ""moderate fecal loading"" - so I started laxatives which seemed to clear me out but also gave me extreme stomach cramps. My pain started to get worse - it felt like I was being stabbed in my lower abdomen into my back. After a few days I went back to the hospital. They did an ultrasound and found everything to be normal - said it could be IBS and sent me on my way. That entire week (last week) - I could not sleep because the pain was so severe. I was taking Tylenol, Naproxen, and Tylenol 2 with no relief or comfort. It was the week from hell. I had another ultrasound where they found signs of a kidney stone / hydronephrosis (kidney swelling) and told me to go back to the ER. I was relieved because I thought the cause of my pain was found - turns out the CT scan they did showed nothing. I have been given back a diagnosis of IBS. I also had a stool test and multiple blood tests done - all clear with no signs of infection or parasites. All my organs are healthy and functioning normally.

Since last week, my pain has gotten better, but it is not gone. I am feeling a constant pressure / pain all along my low abdomen, having weird bowel movements (soft and lots of small sausage pieces - not like the big normal ""logs"" before this episode). The only thing that seems to relieve this pressure / pain is when I am walking around or standing - otherwise if I am sitting or lying down it is all I can feel or think about. My doctor has recommended therapy for stress which I am also trying. I have been referred to a GI and GYNO, but there are long waiting lists here, so no clue when I will get in.

I have been doing a multitude of diets - low FODMAP, cutting out wheat / dairy, and bland foods. Lots of water. Started a probiotic (Renew Life), peppermint capsules, psyllium husk capsules, apple cider vinegar gummies, etc. I'm at wits end trying to get through my daily life (I know it has only been a bit over a month) but it feels like this pain will never go away / I am going crazy / driving everyone around me crazy.

I would love to hear any advice / personal opinions / recommendations on where to go from here. Thank you so much.","Need some help with diagnosis - IBS symptoms?

The connection to stress is obviously very nasty since many nice things involve stress and then it brings this on.
Also motion sickness lingers even though I read it's supposed go away after the cause is eliminated. Not sure if that can be related tho.

Last night he spent from 6pm-4am pacing around the basement talking about the mafia. When he goes on his rants, we are literally unable to get him to stop. We've been patient, but I've yelled at him to be quiet while I was on a phone call and he didn't even react like I was even there.

Every day he sits on the couch, stares at the wall, and laughs hysterically every 2 minutes or so. 

He has no problem eating or using the bathroom, but forget asking him to do any favors for you, or make any sort of effort.

This was all brought on by long time meth usage. He doesn't hear stuff anymore, but he's been hospitalized for being physically threatening 3 times now. For some reason he gets out of inpatient the day he gets in.

He can easily tell you the correct date, the president, where he is. But then he will follow it up with an intricate story about how he survived a drive by shooting playing in a sandbox when he was 2 years old with me and my mom and some snakes.

Risperidone doesn't help. Oh and he's medication non-compliant. He will RAGE if we ask him to take his antipsychotics. He's convinced they're poison (tbh i'm on them too and i hate them but its the only way i function).

He will scream at strangers saying they killed the sandy hook kids. He won't move from the checkout line after finishing. He has to be reminded to get off the toilet after pooping. Or leaving the shower.

We tell him he needs to see a psychiatrist but he says every time ""Huh? Nothings wrong with me. Maybe YOU need to be hospitalized."". He's tried to escape multiple times from the hospital.

I feel like this all boils down to two things:

1. He is extremely psychotic
2. He has a complete mental block stopping him from becoming self aware about his mental illness. So much so that he broke off our engagement, and regressed to being 9 years old and screamed when a doctor told him what was going wrong with him.

Before all of this? Picture perfect man. $160,000/year complicated IT job. Fantastic interpersonal relationships. A pretty fucked up and neglected childhood, and addicted to adderall which turned into a meth addiction. But this guy had absolutely everything together. Until one day he just snapped.

He used to kiss me awake. Now when I ask him to shut off the light in the bathroom, he says ""I wish I never met you. You're sent from hell to destroy me.""

I can't get him out of the house to see anyone because if he addresses any of his issues, he shuts down and becomes just infinitely more psychotic.

It's ruining many many many people's lives.

Help.","He wont accept help or acknowledge his psychosis. He's low functioning, cannot have a conversation. He can't leave the house without getting lost. Because he wont get help, I cannot handle taking care of both him and myself. How do I get him to wake up from this nightmare?

1072,sqt1mt,t5_2tyg2,"Dumbest thing I ever got psychosis from
Tldr at the bottom!

So I have bipolar one with psychosis. This means I have to be careful with various substances I consume, moreso than most with non-bipolar psychosis, because any number of things can trigger hypomania, which I have about a day and a half to identify as such before it escalates into Mania & psychosis. For example, while I can take stimulant medication for my ADHD fine, if I have 2 cups of coffee in one day I absolutely cannot have any coffee for the next day or so, because.ill go hypo and them manic. Because idk, bodies are weird. 

But my absolute biggest trigger is antidepressants. Every single antidepressant I've ever tried -- Prozac, Lexapro, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, Trazodone, every single one -- has trigged mania. Usually within 1-3 days of starting it, regardless of other meds I'm on. Prozac made me manic and unable to sleep *while I was on Seroquel* for fucks sake. Thats how sensitive to them I am. 

So one christmas, I was gifted some lotion, and because I have excessively dry hands and also crochet, I was thrilled. I immediately put some on, and did again before bed. The next morning, I woke up at 5am on the dot. ""...weird,"" I thought, ""but sometimes that just happens. I'll keep an eye on it."" I got up. I put the lotion on. Suddenly I have a flurry of ideas for my art. Again, suspicious. I ask my husband if I seem manic, he says I'm talking fast and fidgeting more than usual. Hmm. Okay. Guess I'm probably hypomanic.

But hypomania doesn't always progress into Mania for me, sometimes when I have ""natural"" (non-triggered) episodes, it's a 50/50 shot, and I have a longer ramp-up time -- generally around 3-5 days. So I decide to just write down the start date if the episode and some symptoms so I remember to tell my psychiatrist at our next appointment. Then I go about my day, slightly more impulsive and talkative than usual, and before bed I apply the lotion again. It's doing wonders for me hands, and I'm excited. 

But when I lay down, well, shit hits the fan. My kind is going faster than I can comprehend. I have a burning desire to go for a run (I am physically disabled, this is near-impossible for me). I start planning two novels, a poetry collection, and three blankets in my head. I ask my husband if he exists. He tells me to call my psychiatrist tomorrow and try to sleep. 

I roll around in bed before deciding ""fuck it,"" and getting up. It's three in the morning. I decide to download over 50 sims 4 mods and boot up the game. I call my psychiatrist, even though it is not even dawn. ""Hey, uhh, I'm suddenly having a bad, fast episode for no reason. I think I need emergency meds. Nothing is real."" I hang up, then turn to grab the lotion on my desk...and I see it has St. John's Wort in it. Which is an antidepressant. 

I spend the next several hours frantically googling and playing Sims, because attention has never been my strong suit, especially not while Manic As Fuck. At 8am my psych calls me and asks what's going on. 

""Can St John's Wort absorb through the skin?"" I ask him. 

""What?""

""St. John's Wort. Can it absorb through the skin?"" There's a pause. I realize he has not context so I continue. ""I was trying to figure out why I was suddenly horribly manic. I was gifted some lotion recently with St John's Wort and didn't realize. Do you think it could absulorb through the skin and make me manic like every other antidepressant?""

""I...don't see why not?"" He pauses. I hear papers shuffling. ""You sound Manic for sure. Should I send in some Seroquel? Just enough to get you out of this episode?"" 

""That would be great,"" I reply.

""Sending it now. See you next week.""

Tldr: got a new lotion. Used it for several days, became Very Manic very fast. Turns out it had St John's Wort, an antidepressant, in it, which can absorb through the skin.

Then I felt another one coming on about a week after getting on allo, but I had colchicine and indomethacin at the ready and when I felt the tingle, went at it voraciously. 

So its been a few weeks since then. I thought allo was working okay but Ive had that warm maybe feeling for about 3 days in a row. Ive taken indomethacin and I bet I wont shit for a week. Trying to get prednisone from rheumatologist but she hasnt gotten back to me yet. 

Its just weird. Feels like the indo is keeping it at bay. I took 3 the first day(50mg pills), 3 the 2nd day. Felt like it went away. Then one pill last night cause it came back and tonight again its feeling warm and threatening. 

I know if I dont get in front of this itll be a 2 weeks or more episode. Every day I feel like the ongoing allo and indo meds are working on it, and keeping it at bay, but I wont stop fretting/popping indo until the warmth is gone.

1079,rzibes,t5_2s1h9,"Can Anyone Suggest What May Be Happening?
I'm a F(37) and formally diagnosed with epilespy at age 17; however my parents and myself believe I had seizures before due to certain things: ""time slowing down"", hearing voices of teachers/friends at night, waking up screaming and running to my parents, vomiting on my sister (we shared a bed) and not knowing who my mom was. All of these things happened from six months-ten thirteen of age.

Back to the point:

I was diagnosed because I had a  tonic-clonic seizure at school. I had another the following week. Another another a month later (I woke, got really tight and had one). I then had another two a year later. And three more in my 20s; during one I was found crying, in another I broke a closet door and a huge bruise on my leg, and in the last one I came stumbling out of my bedroom - my mom thought I was having/had had a stroke. The last one was in my late 20s. I had been on meds that whole time. During the last one I was brought to the ER and given something to calm down.

In 2017 (ag 33), I believe I had a seizure, but I'm unsure: while at work, a seemed to ""go away"" - strazing into distance - I only ""came back"" when a student called out my name.  I was put on more meds.

In 2019, I had a seizure in which I cried, rocked, and kept talking about weird things: people were going tokilling me,people coming for me -hallucations. I was brought to the ER and given a shot to calm me down. I took a week off of work. I was put on different meds.

In the late spring/mid-summer of 2021, I has two more seizures, that were the same as above. My meds went up.

On October 31st of 2021, I had a seizure (like the one in 2019 and in 2020),; however it lasted much longer (45 minutes), so I was brought to the ER. I had several smaller seizures that were similar over the course of 5 hours. The ER could tell me nothing and gave me a shot to calm me down. Before this one, I felt off - tingling in my legs, an odd feeling around me.

On November 1st, I began having seizures (again, the same as above) at 6:00 am and had them on and off until 5:00 pm-ish. I was brought to another ER.  I do have lesions on the brain from a stroke I had at birth (leading to CP), so after a CT which they thought was weird, they did an MRI. They came back clean. I was having the larger seizures during both.

I then spent all of November and most December I had 1-4 seizures a day. I had seizures as I had in 2019-November 1st of 2021. On November fifth, I began to have smaller seizures were I laughed and had a small tick in which I'd click my tongue and then make noises like 'Whoa' or talk to myself in a weird voice. Sometimes I'd laugh, click my tongue and then jerk my head to the left side. The left sde is were I had my stroke. I also kept having the larger seizures once to twice a week.

I was absent from my job all of December and most of November (I kept trying to go back to work.) During December, I was seizure free from the 12th to the 30th.  I had a larger seizure (same as above) once and then two more large ones in the early afternoon Jan 3rd. I went back to work on Jan 3rd; thinkfully my students weren't there, as they have already witnessed two.

I don't know if this will be important, but sometimes after the larger ones, I become ""child like"" and want people to stay with me. Before them, I  would seek out my parents, whom I stayed with from November 2nd until December 20th.

I have seen three neurologist in the past two months. My regular one quickly suggest a surgery. The next one did an EEG, and despite me having small laughing seizures, he stated it came back with no seizure actvity. The third suggested that I may be having two or three seizures at once and in different parts of the brain, or that I may be having a seizure which is setting something else off, or that I may not be having seizures at all,but that something else is happening, due to the fact that my jerking and rocking don't look like seizure normal seizure movement. Of course, I do have CP, so that may be why the movements are off. This doctor was the best I'd seen. However, he stated that he didn't feel comfortable ordering tests, as he's not an expert or my regular neurolgist, but he sent his thoughts along to my regular doctor.

If you got this far, thank you. Now, can anyone give a guess or advide on what is happening. I'm a bit scared that there may be a major issue. The epilespy speacilists in my state are all booked until April. I have another appointment with my regular doctor on Monday. I have thought about taking a 90 sick leave from work, though I doctor would have to suggest it.","Can Anyone Suggest What May Be Happening?
I'm a F(37) and formally diagnosed with epilespy at age 17; however my parents and myself believe I had seizures before due to certain things: ""time slowing down"", hearing voices of teachers/friends at night, waking up screaming and running to my parents, vomiting on my sister (we shared a bed) and not knowing who my mom was. All of these things happened from six months-ten thirteen of age.

Back to the point:

I was diagnosed because I had a  tonic-clonic seizure at school. I had another the following week. Another another a month later (I woke, got really tight and had one). I then had another two a year later. And three more in my 20s; during one I was found crying, in another I broke a closet door and a huge bruise on my leg, and in the last one I came stumbling out of my bedroom - my mom thought I was having/had had a stroke. The last one was in my late 20s. I had been on meds that whole time. During the last one I was brought to the ER and given something to calm down.

In 2017 (ag 33), I believe I had a seizure, but I'm unsure: while at work, a seemed to ""go away"" - strazing into distance - I only ""came back"" when a student called out my name.  I was put on more meds.

In 2019, I had a seizure in which I cried, rocked, and kept talking about weird things: people were going tokilling me,people coming for me -hallucations. I was brought to the ER and given a shot to calm me down. I took a week off of work. I was put on different meds.

In the late spring/mid-summer of 2021, I has two more seizures, that were the same as above. My meds went up.

On October 31st of 2021, I had a seizure (like the one in 2019 and in 2020),; however it lasted much longer (45 minutes), so I was brought to the ER. I had several smaller seizures that were similar over the course of 5 hours. The ER could tell me nothing and gave me a shot to calm me down. Before this one, I felt off - tingling in my legs, an odd feeling around me.

On November 1st, I began having seizures (again, the same as above) at 6:00 am and had them on and off until 5:00 pm-ish. I was brought to another ER.  I do have lesions on the brain from a stroke I had at birth (leading to CP), so after a CT which they thought was weird, they did an MRI. They came back clean. I was having the larger seizures during both.

I then spent all of November and most December I had 1-4 seizures a day. I had seizures as I had in 2019-November 1st of 2021. On November fifth, I began to have smaller seizures were I laughed and had a small tick in which I'd click my tongue and then make noises like 'Whoa' or talk to myself in a weird voice. Sometimes I'd laugh, click my tongue and then jerk my head to the left side. The left sde is were I had my stroke. I also kept having the larger seizures once to twice a week.

I was absent from my job all of December and most of November (I kept trying to go back to work.) During December, I was seizure free from the 12th to the 30th.  I had a larger seizure (same as above) once and then two more large ones in the early afternoon Jan 3rd. I went back to work on Jan 3rd; thinkfully my students weren't there, as they have already witnessed two.

I don't know if this will be important, but sometimes after the larger ones, I become ""child like"" and want people to stay with me. Before them, I  would seek out my parents, whom I stayed with from November 2nd until December 20th.

I have seen three neurologist in the past two months. My regular one quickly suggest a surgery. The next one did an EEG, and despite me having small laughing seizures, he stated it came back with no seizure actvity. The third suggested that I may be having two or three seizures at once and in different parts of the brain, or that I may be having a seizure which is setting something else off, or that I may not be having seizures at all,but that something else is happening, due to the fact that my jerking and rocking don't look like seizure normal seizure movement. Of course, I do have CP, so that may be why the movements are off. This doctor was the best I'd seen. However, he stated that he didn't feel comfortable ordering tests, as he's not an expert or my regular neurolgist, but he sent his thoughts along to my regular doctor.

If you got this far, thank you. Now, can anyone give a guess or advide on what is happening. I'm a bit scared that there may be a major issue.

1106,stvz18,t5_2syer,"Discussion/Opinion: Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia
&#x200B;

[Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia: Hints for Better Lifestyle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/)

Folks it's articles like this that I think cause a lot of confusion on gout.  People come here looking for ways to avoid being on life long medication or how to mitigate pain or how to stop a flare.  This article points to a lot of the things people try to control gout flares that aren't drugs.  Please understand control of uric acid levels - when talking about gout means keeping your UA levels lower than 6mg/dL (5 if you have tophi) and keeping it there.  Everything else is trying to stop gout flaring - your immune system response to monosodium urate crystals.

[Why does the gout attack stop? A roadmap for the immune pathogenesis of gout](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl_1/e000046)

In reality you have probably been hyperuricemic for quite some time (years) as uric acid isn't usually tested unless there is an issue.  Monosodium urate crystals have been building up in your joints.  Then one day you stub your toe or eat that trigger food that causes inflammation - and you have a gout flare.  You take anti-inflammatories(NASID) and/or immunosuppressants(colchicine) to stop your immune system response.  At some point the immune system may stop and the crystals get sheathed - until you stub your toe again or eat that foot that causes inflammation.  Rinse/Repeat.  The gout flares ebb and flow with your immune system response - not with crystals coming and going.  When you go onto a Urate lowering therapy it could be months to years before all the crystals dissolve - even though your uric acid is held low.  6 months after I had my UA levels at 5.5mg/dL - I still flared which means that there were still MSU crystals present.  Controlling serum uric acid levels needs to be a constant low - with a threat of flaring anyway as the crystals dissolve and the sheaths get disturbed.  Eating your way to a low enough serum acid level is difficult in my experience.

>Since uric acid is an end-product of purine metabolism in humans, it is reasonable to suggest that excessive ingestion of purine-rich foods causes an increase in serum uric acid. In fact, ingestion of RNA (corresponding to 225 mg purine/kg of body weight) increased plasma uric acid by **0.74 mg/dL,** indicating that excessive consumption of purine increases plasma uric acid concentration.[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr23-1559827615601973) However, not all purine-containing foods have the same effect on serum uric acid level and gout risk.

>**A purine-rich diet for 1 to 2 weeks produces only a small transient rise in serum uric acid level of 1 to 2 mg/dL, while an isocaloric low-purine diet for 7 to 10 days will slightly reduce serum uric acid by about 1 to 2 mg/dL**.[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr30-1559827615601973),[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr31-1559827615601973) **suggesting that strict restriction of consumption of purine is not practical or effective for uric acid control.** Accordingly, adequate calorie intake and weight management with moderation of meat and seafood in the diet has been recently recommended for gout/hyperuricemia subjects.

This has been my experience.  On the extreme end - on a keto/low carb high fat diet (LCHF) - I have lost a lot of weight \~50lbs down now - and have dropped my serum acid levels from 5.5mg/dL to 4.5mg/dL.  In addition I eat a lot of high purine foods - red meat, anchovies, shellfish.  I am just one person but I am adding my anecdotal evidence that it isn't purine ingestion that causes serum acid levels to rise.

TL;DR - My take - Gouty Arthritis is curable - by lowering your UA levels low enough for MSU crystals to dissolve.  Hyperuricemia is manageable through daily ULT medication.  Eating and supplementation typically only addresses flaring (Gouty Arthritis) - not Hyperuricimea (UA levels > 6.8mg/dL)

TL;DR2 - Do everything you can to lose weight, be healthy, eat right, stay hydrated - these are all good things - but do not be discouraged if you can't control your gout with these things.  There are safe and effective drugs that have been FDA tested and approved.","Discussion/Opinion: Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia


[Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia: Hints for Better Lifestyle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/)

Folks it's articles like this that I think cause a lot of confusion on gout.  People come here looking for ways to avoid being on life long medication or how to mitigate pain or how to stop a flare.  This article points to a lot of the things people try to control gout flares that aren't drugs.  Please understand control of uric acid levels - when talking about gout means keeping your UA levels lower than 6mg/dL (5 if you have tophi) and keeping it there.  Everything else is trying to stop gout flaring - your immune system response to monosodium urate crystals.

[Why does the gout attack stop? A roadmap for the immune pathogenesis of gout](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl_1/e000046)

In reality you have probably been hyperuricemic for quite some time (years) as uric acid isn't usually tested unless there is an issue.  Monosodium urate crystals have been building up in your joints.  Then one day you stub your toe or eat that trigger food that causes inflammation - and you have a gout flare.  You take anti-inflammatories(NASID) and/or immunosuppressants(colchicine) to stop your immune system response.  At some point the immune system may stop and the crystals get sheathed - until you stub your toe again or eat that foot that causes inflammation.  Rinse/Repeat.  The gout flares ebb and flow with your immune system response - not with crystals coming and going.

1110,sx97h8,t5_2saq9,"New here. How to get my doctor to take me seriously?
Hello. This is a bit long. I apologize. 

With a complicated medical history, I am afraid my doctor is either out of her depth or thinks I am a hypochondriac. Who knows? Maybe both. Im worried about her taking me seriously when it comes to being evaluated for POTS. I dont know how to approach the question. 

First let me say that I had a serious case of Lyme disease that left me on social security disability for 3 years. I finally got back into the work force in 2017.  Since then I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and I dont know if thats because my doctors were more comfortable coming up with a treatment plan for fibro than the chronic effects of Lyme, or if the fibro is a catch-all diagnosis, or if I actually have fibro. 

Lifestyle changes and medication for fibro have certainly improved my quality of life, but I have never stopped feeling like there is something else going on. 

For years now, I have been getting bouts of lightheadedness, dizziness, and coming close to passing out when I stand up. To the point where the room closes in and I have to grab on to whatever is closest. I have never actually passed out, but come right to the edge. 

I also struggle with terrible fatigue, brain fog, weakness, and feeling disoriented. I know these symptoms over lap with fibromyalgia and Lyme. 

About 3 years ago I was having more and more GI issues -especially nausea but also indigestion, heartburn, constipation, and lots of noises from my stomach (other than gas). So I saw a specialist who after many tests diagnosed me with GERD. I felt it was more than just that. But, being exhausted with the medical system I gave up. Symptoms have not gone away. 

Then I started to get purple feet when sitting. I had some tests but was ultimately told it was poor circulation from sitting on a hard chair. 

2 years ago  I was having chest pain and feeling thirsty all the time- drinking over a gallon of water a day and still thirsty. I was also being woken up in the middle of the night by chest pain. I had some blood tests. No diabetes. I had a heart monitor for a week and no findings. I chose to go off my adderall that I take for ADHD even though I had never experienced cardiac symptoms from it before. There was an improvement of symptoms but they didnt go away completely. 

Then my brain fog got incredibly bad and I was feeling so lightheaded that I would sometimes be disoriented which could be very scary (especially if I was driving). I realized it was often very bad after a meal. I tried to get help from my PCP, but she said these things are very hard to diagnose and suggested I needed to go back on my adderall. So I did and it helped to an extent.  

Well, recently I have seen my toes turn blue and legs become mottled blue and red in the shower (shockingly so). Looking like I got beat up. Knowing how none of my concerns over the last few years were resolved and how I felt rather brushed off, Ive tried to ignore it. Ive tried not to look it up online and get pulled down the rabbit hole, but it kept eating at me like what if this is the clue I need?  So I did and thats how I came to POTS.  

So I did a test at home and tested my heart rate after lying down for 5 mins. Then stood up and tested it again every 2 minutes for 10 minutes. This is the result: 

95 bpm lying down 
126 bpm after 2 minutes standing
130 bpm after 4 minutes standing 
133 bpm after 6 minutes standing 
138 bpm after 8 minutes standing 
148 bpm after 10 minutes standing 

I feel very strongly this all adds up to POTS. Can you please give me some advice on how to approach the situation to be taken seriously and not looked at like Ive self diagnosed ?","New here. How to get my doctor to take me seriously?

My last MRI in October showed some new lesions (while others have gotten smaller), but my neurologist assumes the new lesions are from my flair up before starting my DMT. I know MS affects everyone different, but I have honestly not had any long lasting symptoms. I feel normal despite having lesions in my brain and spinal cord.

So Ive posted here a few times now. Im 17F, and the last 2 years now Ive been in and out of the hospital. I have been extremely sick since I was a kid. But it blew over the edge two years ago. My legs gave out from under me, my vision stopped being mine, almost like somebody possessed my eyes, and I became extremely dizzy and sick. Ive had a lot of symptoms of MS and so then did a MRI on my brain, I have 2 lesions and an recently they said they found another abnormality is what they are calling it. Thats all hes told me, there was no further explanation. I had a spinal tap back in September but my results havent came back yet somehow.

1123,skr1ps,t5_2syer,"Just diagnosed, looking for general advice
I had a gout attack in the last few weeks, my first one, and my GP hasn't been overly helpful. Attack didn't seem like a typical gout flare up, pain was severe in my left big toe but swelling wasn't really noticeable at all, the area was slightly red. Been on a mostly plant based diet except for low fat milk in my tea and coffee. I had been drinking alcohol at Christmas but havent had any since new year's Day, attack was mid January. I don't drink alcohol often, when I do it's probably 50/50 whether I only have one or two Vs probably drinking too much, but it'd be common for me to go a few months without touching a drop, I really only socially drink alcohol but I do love it when I get to. Doc just did a blood test and I got a call from his receptionist saying test confirmed gout. I asked if there was a follow up or if the blood test screened out possibilities like diabetes or kidney disease, she just said that the drs note was that the test confirmed gout and advice was to just watch my diet. As far as I can tell my diet for the last few months doesn't have any obvious triggers for gout except maybe for the alcohol at Christmas.

I'm a man, turn 31 this year, I'm overweight: height 5""11 and weight: 16 stone. I'm seeing a lot of different things online, some pretty scary stuff about how linked gout is with more serious conditions like heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes - would the blood test have screened for those or did he probably just check for uric acid levels? Do I need to get screened for those after getting a gout diagnosis?

I'm going to try and get a different doctor to talk over all this as well and book in with a dietician but any advice or input would be appreciated, going a bit crazy with all the gout doom and gloom I'm seeing online. When I go out for drinks I love a few beers, are they completely off the menu for me now or are there any low purine beers that a few won't cause too much of an issue? Is everyone different with regards to what triggers them? Fretting over the alcohol seems odd I know but I'm getting married this year and now worried about drinking on my stag do and wedding day leading to a world of pain again.","Just diagnosed, looking for general advice

1124,pwkdws,t5_2syer,"Gout in pinky knuckle
Well I guess Im following my fathers footsteps. Before he passed at 68 his knuckles looked like golf balls from untreated gout. I have been prone to flare ups in both my right and left big toes since my early 20s. Now in my mid 30s, I have just had my first flare up in my right hand pinky knuckle. I got to say its just as painful as getting it in the toe. I dont know why every doctor I go to either prescribes me colchicine, prednisone or indomethacin. I would think with a flare up 1-2 times a year they would start me on a maintenance drug, especially with the family history. I thought it might be a staff infection since Ive never had a flare up in my hand. So Im sitting at urgent care waiting to see what they say. I was sick all last week with the flu and I think that is what triggered it. I hadnt had any alcohol and was avoiding eating heavy as well as red meat. It could have been a mix of a little dehydration and weakened immune system. Has anyone else experienced a flare up after being sick with a bug?","Gout in pinky knuckle

The doctor said it was gerd when I saw them last but Im worried and havent had any testing done.  I scheduled another appointment later this month.   I havent had symptoms like arm pain or numbness, not short of breath, but the pain is really intense and is in my upper stomach, sternum, and some times radiate to my back.  Its so scary.

1142,smi2py,t5_2tyg2,"Having a job and psychosis (open discretion).
It can really be difficult working while having psychosis.

In my case when Im at work and hear voices it really makes me anxious.

The worse part is that I actually work in a restaurant and sometimes I hear people screaming or really loud noises, I go outside and all the tables and empty.

Having a psychotic episode and working it can be so stressful because you need to try to do your best while not being in touch with reality.

Dealing with coworkers/clients can be weird for me because I need to try to do my best to act like Im not loosing it.

But at the end depends by what job and what state of mind you are(?)

Okay I feel like this is going to be really hard to explain.

I have been diagnosed with RRMS since February 21 after my initial optic neuritis flair up the previous August. I am currently lying in bed experiencing my first relapse since I was diagnosed. My DMT is ocrevus and I'm due my next infusion in a months time.

The fatigue is the worst for me... like my muscles don't want to move. BUT my mind being the overthinking machine it is, it keeps telling me stuff like ""oh you could get up if you wanted to, you're just being lazy, you're a fraud"" 

My own mind is my worst enemy, it is telling me I have imposter syndrome for something I can SEE on an MRI scan. 

It could be because im missing the activities I do in daily life, like I'd usually go to the gym, do pilates, go for walks etc. My mind is like oh yeah you can totally get up and do that, go on just get up! And I can't get up, and that makes me really sad and frustrated.

I have no idea if anyone else ever feels like this, I just really wanted to let out some feelings. Thank you for listening xx


EDIT: I am amazed at how many of you feel like this. I felt so alone this morning when I wrote this, thank you to everyone who has reassured me. You are all amazing people, I love this community xx","Feeling like a fraud.

Hey yall. I got sick last Saturday and diarrhea turned to constipation on Monday. I believe I have IBS-C due to ongoing problems with constipation over the last 20 years, so I tend toward constipation 90% of the time and I'm sensitive to sudden bouts. I also restarted SSRIs which may have contributed to this.

 I feel much better flu-wise, but the constipation is keeping my energy and hopes low, I'm very fatigued, and my appetite is very suppressed. I'm an emetaphobe so I'm very scared of throwing up and tend to refuse to eat once I feel a twinge of nausea. 

I'm steadily losing about half a pound a day and it's freaking me out. I know the lack of appetite and steady, fluctuating nausea is keeping me from eating, which I'm sure isn't helping due to a lack of fibre and substance to help push this down and out. I started forcing myself to drink extra water than usual (I'm terrible for not drinking) and a few glasses of gatorade yesterday but still no movement. My last bm was Thursday (2 days ago) but it was very small and took forever to pass. No pain, just feels like it won't move from my lower gut to my rectum. 

Is there anything I can do to increase my appetite or bypass nausea so I can try to get three substantial meals into me?

I then got into other delusions like I was in hell, a lot of bullshit and stuff, but no major hallucinations despite that one.

The thing was that I was in chronic stress and major restless, had to do a lot but I wasnt resting enough.

I had to pick hotel rooms to sleep, bc the administrator here just would do nothing. I couldnt make her stop. Now she stopped.

Hi! I'm 18F and at the end of October I started experiencing out-of-nowhere symptoms like jaw pain, followed by sinus and ear pain & pressure, constant need to pop them etc. After a week the jaw pain went away, but the ear issues stayed and maybe another week later, I strated experiencing classic LPR symptoms. Mainly throat congestion, globus sensation, sore throat, regurgitation, burping and very often an acidic taste at the back of my throat. My ears were still the same during that time along with some itching. I was then diagnosed with reflux, got Omeprazole for it. 

However, maybe 2 weeks after I strated taking it, the symptoms didn't improve a lot and on top of it, I got bilateral tinnitus. I went to my ENT again and asked if it could be because of the PPIs or reflux but he denied it. By then my reflux symptoms were better so he told me to continue the medication and started focusing on my tinnitus as a separate condition. Was told I have perfect hearing, there is no fluid and my eardrums are fine, so they couldn't find the cause. 

But today my LPR flared a lot and along with it, so did my tinnitus. My ears itch and hurt a bit again. I always thought the two to be related as they started only weeks away from each other, but discarded that thought because my doctors did. Now I looked it up and apparently there are people who have tinnitus/ear issues as a symptom of reflux. I also have hyperacusis.

Could it really be the cause of my tinnitus? Could the PPI's be the cause? I don't know if I should stop them because if I do, my reflux will worsen and so may the tinnitus. I was already taking them 20mg every other day the last 12 days. But if they're the culprit... I'm also scared 3 months is too long and that stopping them wouldn't help anymore :( Maybe switch to a different one?

 I tend to be one who keeps things bottled up. However for my own mental health. I decided to just vent here about it. TL/DR at bottom. 

&#x200B;

  
  So I have been having the worst life. I understand that people in Africa are probably a lot worse off but to my own standards, my life has just not been good. Starting from when I was young my school life was pretty horrible. I was constantly bullied and made fun of. The reason being was that my clothes were continuously smelling like marijuana. The bullying is what made me start to hate going to school. I would try to fake sick a lot, just to not go. Now you probably wondering why a child smelling like marijuana anyway? And after saying that you probably found the answer...My parents. That answer is why I absolutely hate weed and would never smoke it. They would smoke EVERY SINGLE DAY. Not giving a damn where they did it, or what they did it near. Thus brings in my uniform clothes. Being smoked up and me having to wear them the next day. I hated it so much.   
  Around the start of my 8th grade year. My family broke up because of my mother cheating. Her reasons for cheating, I don't really care about at this point. But after it happen my father decided to stop paying the rent to our apartment so we would lose it. We wind up moving to another city in a shitty basement. No rooms, had to separate the kids room and parents room with a blanket hanging up. I was then taking a train everyday to school to finish my 8th grade year. Lots of times I wouldn't even go home early, I would just try to chill with my older brother who lived with some people on the floor above our old apartment. I really enjoyed spending time with him and looked up to him. This made me happy so I did it a lot. At my graduation my parents got me a suit from someplace. But it was a weird silver suit that I was convinced into liking when I really didn't. What's worse is showing up to dance in that suit and seeing everyone wearing normal suits. Did not make me feel good, and made it worse when the next day at graduation everyone wore a different suit and I again wore that same suit.   
  I'm not sure what exactly happen over the summer but for some reason, I guess because of arguments, my mother decided to leave and take us and go stay with our cousins for like a week at their fancy big house in New Jersey. And then we went to a shelter after. This was a domestic violence shelter. Which I can tell you now, we definitely was taking a room from some actual survivor of DV. This would be the start of a trend because my high school life was also horrible. I went to a lot of different high schools because I basically lived shelter to shelter. My mother, my sister and I would go into a shelter, go out and have our own apartment, lose that apartment SOMEHOW??? and then be back in the shelter again. I also had to wear clothing the shelter gave us which just made me feel horrible. I slept a lot in school barely did work and was just fed up with how my life was at that point. I couldn't wait till I could get home and lose myself In my games. My high school graduation was no different then the first. Went to prom alone, with a suit and tie that was giving to me by the shelter system. Didn't even notice they gave me a tux shirt to wear with the suit jacket till I was at prom and someone pointed it out. Don't even know why I even went to it. Graduation same thing, same tuxedo suit.   

&#x200B;

  
  When I graduated high school I thought it was time to finally be done with school in total so I decided not to pursue a college degree. This would later effect me big time. But at this time I really didn't know what I wanted to do. I wanted to do game design but I would try to learn it through little websites with their own silly little engines. I would run into problems though and everyone would be a complete asshole telling me to figure out the problem myself instead of just telling me what I did wrong. This cause me to quit that and I really didn't know what I wanted to do. It didn't help that I was constantly verbally abused by my father whenever he would visit my mom. Constantly being told what I should be doing with my life. Constantly being compared to my sister who decided to attend college. Constantly being told that I should attend a trade school and become a shitty ass mechanic. I've had arguments a lot with him about this. It was always just something with him. I also would like to point out that, and I'm sure most know, but when you live with a parent and you aren't working and you aren't paying bills either, they really really hate that. Something about you just existing just pisses them off for some reason, regardless if you just keep to yourself. So I basically had to force myself to get a job and I did. Wind up getting a nice lil job as a security guard. It was part time though but the pay was really good for a part time job. Was able to pay my own little bills, buy what I wanted. Bought the food I wanted to eat. Thought I was going to be able to maybe save up and just do whatever but the more I bought what I wanted the more I made people mad. Turns out that me working and buying what I want is just me wasting my money on foolish things. Turns out that me working this Security Job is also me being lazy because I wont get a job where I am constantly on my feet doing something....This will be a running theme later. 

&#x200B;

  
  My brother winds up moving in with my mother and that later on causes problems. My mother who it seems wasn't even paying the rent at that time decided to move in with someone else leaving everyone at that apartment to fend for themselves. This was the first red flag I should of payed attention to. My sister was in a dorm, so she was OK. My brother was left there alone, and my father decided to take me in which he made sure to let me know that he didn't want to. My brother and I have different fathers so there wasn't really any hope for him. He winds up finding a place so that was good. When living with my dad it was horrible. He lived with his sister and his family obsessed over the smallest or stupid of things. Turning things that shouldn't be a problem into a problem. Like not coming out the room to greet whoever is in the kitchen with a good morning. Like what the hell? Or getting upset because someone is their internet when they aren't there. Going so far as to change the password on me. Silly things like this. Not to mention I was still working my security job at this time, So I had to commute 3 hours there and 3 hours back from New York to New Jersey. Just for a little bit of money. I also had a extra bill now, storage. I really didn't want to lose my things. So I put everything in storage. I would later take some things out of storage to use at his house which to my surprise was the worse thing because when I put my things in the storage, some of it got infested with bed bugs. So bringing the few things back to his place started a problem which I was definitely solely blamed for. Because I of course knew that there was bed bugs in it.... We manage to get rid of the bed bugs but didn't matter. My father would complain that I'm on my computer and not out doing something. We would have lots of arguments too because he would try to tell me when I can or cant use my things, and it was the most annoying thing ever. It would always just make my blood boil when someone who didn't contribute to what I have tells me what to do with it. This was again a red flag that I should of really remembered.   

&#x200B;

  
  After constantly being blamed for things for no reason I was sick of living there. My mother called me and tried to borrow money from me because she was about to have nowhere to go. She was having problems with the person she moved in with and now that person decided they was just going to move and leave her there. This was ironic but also another red flag that for some reason I decided to let just pass me by. So me being the good guy, who also has problems with the people he living with decided that I would lend my money to her so she can use it as a security deposit and get us a place we can live together. I wind up staying at a hotel with her and going to work from there. At this time, she was a very supportive mother because I had helped her. You can kind of say she was at my beck and call, going so far to even wash my uniform clothes in the tub so that they would be clean. We wind up finding a small little one bedroom on Craigslist. I was told I would have the room, which was barely a room in fact the whole place would turn out to be illegal. She said she would have the living room as her room. It was basically like a reverse of the place we stayed at before she left my brother and I stranded. Things were fine so far. I was closer to my job again but this time a 30 minute commute to it and not 3 hours. My sister would start to live with us when it was school break, because colleges kick kids out their dorms on breaks??? Anyway, more people in the house now so of course more problems. My mother started complaining more about things. Things that, not only did it make no sense to complain about, but also it was things SHE DID. So it made 0 sense. She also needed to borrow money a lot for some reason, just for her habits. So she would constantly borrow from me. She borrowed a bit from my sister but my sister shut that down real quick after a point. She was smart, she saw the flags, I was a fool. So being the person I am I let her borrow money time and time again. And all I asked was that when I needed the money to please pay me back. I never rushed anyone to pay me back or anything like that. Just give me it when I need it. Well when you give people things it all good, but when its time to pay back...PROBLEMS. My mother happen to get some money, which I believe was income tax. At this point I was assuming she would pay me back. When I asked her about if she was going to, her response was, Once I pay you and your sister, I will have nothing left. Now this was strange and I am confused why this was said to me, but I'm not really sure how exactly that's my problem. I mean call me crazy but don't you borrow money because you need the money right then and there and cant wait to save up to use it? It would make total sense for you to now, after borrowing money, to use the new money you got to pay back the lender But I guess not. After arguments about it I was finally given a good amount of my money back, with the promise of paying the rest back. I was content so it didn't matter.   

&#x200B;

  
  Now you are probably wondering why I posted this here. Well this part is where that answer comes. One day I happen to wake up and look in the mirror and half of my face is drooping. I wind up getting soap in my eyes too because of this, which effected my vision for awhile. So just remember to always look in the mirror before you shower. Anyway, called an ambulance went to hospital. Found out I had MS. I wasn't even mad really, since I was told Ill be kind of OK. Since they have all TYPES OF MEDICINES THESE DAYS WOOHOO. That is until you find out you have to take said medicine every single day for the rest of your life.... I already hate taking meds so this just really hit me hard. But I kept it to myself using my its whatever attitude. My mother tone changed as well. She was starting to and trying to do a lot of stuff for me. Which I really didn't enjoy because it felt like it was for show. Of course it was but I didn't really notice until I had the chance to think back on it. I was also starting to see the switch up. After awhile, me having MS was totally forgotten so everything went back to how it was. Arguments and complaints. When my mother and I first got this place, I had gotten internet only. I told my mom she would not need cable because anything on cable can be seen on the internet. She insisted to get cable as well and said she would pay the difference. I agreed. After a point she stop paying for the cable and made it into a tab. I didn't mind at the time because I again had a job and wasn't really paying much. However I would go on to lose that security job after four years. I then informed my mom, because of how high the cable and internet bill was, that she needs to give me something because this will eat into my savings eventually. Things still became a problem and I wind up turning the cable part off, which she wanted me to do, because she insisted that she doesn't need the cable either. However, when I did turn it off, this really upset her. This will also be a running theme. I was then told I need to find a place to move to because she was going to move with some old lady in a room in her apartment. Notice something? Anyway my sister was there and had just finished school. My sister was fed up with it as well so me and her both agreed to find us a place and live together and be away from the parent bullshit. My sister was working and I was looking for a place and a new job at the same time. My mother, seeing me go out constantly became very noisy. To the point where she inserted herself to come with me and my sister to see one of our places. And then would constantly try to find things wrong with the place so we wouldn't get it. She never even cared about this until she found out my sister and I would be living together. Not sure what she was thinking but after a while, out of nowhere, she suddenly found a 3 bedroom for us to move into together and split. Which I was fine with because I was not going to ever be paying rent for a place I'm living while also being told what I can and cant do in my own place. We decided on who gets what bedroom and signed the lease. Minutes after my mother would then try to take my bedroom and make me have hers, which was the littlest one. Which was not going to happen since we didn't agree on that. Red flag I definitely should of seen. 

&#x200B;

  
  So at this point I am in this new place, my own room. I am currently taking Gilenya for my MS and I am about to start my new job. I felt like everything would start to get better. However it didn't. I thought this job was going to be purely tech support and I was ecstatic because I am a computer guy. I am about to get payed for something that I am constantly doing already. Nope. I do training and then am informed that the company I work for, well they basically loan their employees to other companies and I would have to work under their policies. And boy oh boy who do I get? Shitty Comcast. I hated them as a service and now I am going to have to work for them. I thought it would be OK at first until I was forced to get at least 3 sales a week. This might seem like nothing but for someone who turned down a sales job because they couldn't do it, this was a lot for me. Not only that but I was so used to just letting customers go after helping them with the reason they called. It was pretty hard for me to swindle these old people into upgrading their plans. I wind up getting headaches and stressing over it. It got to a point where as a work at home job I was calling out because I couldn't take just sitting at my PC and having to deal with it all. My headaches can also be contributed to the fact that I was no longer having any medication. When I was getting my medicine it was through Medicaid. And it turns out that If you make at least 1400 a month, then they was no longer going to cover you. I made 1600.. living wage in NJ is 2592. This makes a lot of sense to me. Anyway I had no medicine so I would have constant headaches. Things would easily cause them to come for me. I called out a lot. I needed some form of insurance to help cover this 9000 a month...medicine.. My job was at that moment not giving me insurance. I had to wait till the next Jan 1st to be covered. I was told to look into some type of charity insurance. I spoke to them however they would not cover me unless they got some proof from my job that they did not cover me. So I had to then run around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to figure out who am I suppose to speak to for this. I finally found the people and just my luck these people don't EVER answer phone calls or emails. So I'm sitting there constantly messaging them, Hey have you got my message? Hoping they would reply. This just added onto the stress. I was written up a lot for missing days also. Its funny because I should of known this would happen when I missed a day for my training to go to the doctor and they decided it was inexcusable and made me no longer entitled to the 50 cent extra an hour raise after training ends... Because of the days I missed ,I wind up getting fired. THE DAY AFTER I WAS FIRED I WAS FINALLY MESSAGED BY THE INSURANCE PEOPLE!! They told me that because I no longer worked for them I could not get the insurance.... This absolutely made my blood boil. I then came back to Medicaid and was able to get insurance again. I went with the plan they provided me because it seemed a bit fancy. They was talking about housing and food and all of that stuff. Problem with that though, is that they was not covering my Gilenya. They said yea no, that medicine waaay too expensive. So after taking a few months to even find this out. I decided to switch back to my old plan from Medicaid that did cover it.   

&#x200B;

  
  So at this point my neurologist said, Since you have these problems with coverage and taking medicine I don't want to put you on to medicine and then you later are no longer able to take it. So I will try to put you onto Maven Clad which you wont have to take everyday for the rest of your life. I said OK that sounds really good. I just had to wait now for my insurance to cover it... haha they wont. They absolutely refused. They wanted me to take Gilenya or any other of the daily medicines again. They wanted me to try at least 5 medicines including Gilenya which I don't see how they don't even understand I took Gilenya already. But they wanted me to try the 5 first and if they DONT WORK, then I can use Maven Clad. The problem with this is that it wasn't about them not working. It was about me not being able to get them anymore. So I had to wait and wait and wait. I was on unemployment after this. And the company I worked for decided to fight against me saying I don't deserve unemployment because I broke the rules,(needing to come to work no exceptions.) I had to go against them myself not knowing anything and ultimately I lose. I could of did the whole fight back but after seeing I would only just lose like 2 thousand and can still get unemployment I decided to just let it go. I didn't want to deal with it anymore. Around the time I had about 3 months left on my unemployment COVID happen. I was absolutely terrified of COVID and did not want to get it. I assume with my MS, it was a death sentence. The bright side of this was unemployment increasing 600 dollars. Unfortunately my unemployment was about to run out anyway so it didn't matter too much. The extra pay was nice though. To be honest, I can probably deal with a stressful Job if I'm making 900 a week from it. That's life changing money for someone like me. Alas, it was then decreased to 300 dollars. OK cool that's still fine. I'm still paying my bills and other things with it. After that my unemployment ended. I was trying to get an extension for it. I really messed up here because I should of kept looking for a job. I wanted one remotely but did not want to have to do a job that was tech support and sales. And it seems like almost all jobs that don't require degrees, are tech support and sales mixed in one. Turns out more experience you have, the less work you have to do. Crazy. Anyway I put myself in a jam. I was only doing the minimum require to find a job to continue getting unemployment. Just in case. And I was making way more on unemployment then I did working anyway so why try to work when employers wont offer more. So after COVID happen my mother lost her job. She was using savings to pay rent too and her savings was going very low. She I believe quit because of a fall or something like that. So she couldn't get unemployment. She started borrowing money from the only person she could. Me. Which I gave her. At a certain point my sister had problems with living with us. It was because of things that my mom was known for and she didn't want to be near me anymore because I wouldn't clean the bathroom when she wanted me to. We had rules but a lot of times I would get headaches and not do what I was suppose to at that time. I would do it like a day after or something. Either way after a point she got really mad about this and an argument started. So she decided to move out at the end of the lease. My mother had the galls to try to say I was the one who should move out. So I said sure okay. However my sister didn't want to live with her either. So when she said she still moving out my mother changed her tune again quick fast. Trying to make it seem as if she didn't mean anything by what she said. Because it was me and my mom now we had to split the rent between us now. Which would be a lot. However, my mother decided to get government assistance so that they could pay the rent. The problem with this is that I was there. They was not going to help pay unless I moved out. So my mother acted as if I was not there anymore, and contacted the landlords to take my name off the lease. Making it solely in her name. I really regret me allowing this to happen but I didn't know any better at the time. Moving on, my mother was still in talks with them along with borrowing money from me. Money for weed, money for cigarettes, it would just keep adding up and up. Till a point where she would owe me somewhere of 4k.   

&#x200B;

  
  There was a thing saying I'm allowed an extension on my unemployment. It would also give me 300 per weak as well if I could get it. In total this would be a lot of money for me. Around 6-7k. I let my mom know about it and she was all in. With her getting her money and mine. They plan was to get a place in like PA. And I get a job again save up without having to pay rent and I save up. This was a cool plan but the way she described it was as if I would be staying there for a looong time. I did not want this. I wanted to have my own place with no one around. I was especially tired of coming out my room to smell weed smoke all the time anyway. At this time of living here the rent was not being payed and was piling up. The assistance people decided now they would help since my mother was By her self The only problem is that they found out my mother was getting some type of big money and they said she would need to pay them back. So she got upset about this and basically blamed me saying I should be paying some of that back to her. I didn't agree because that's not of anything what we discussed. Besides I'm not sure how you would get to take my name off lease for assistance but I would need to pay back when you wouldn't get that assistance if my name wasn't removed in the first place. Going back on words was also a running theme. My savings again would start to run low and I would tell my mom she needs to start trying to pay me back. Give me something anything. We had the old cable set up again and of course she wasn't giving me money for that. I also was not getting any unemployment. I couldn't even get in contact with anyone. It would always just say call again tomorrow. Waking up early to call them just for them to say nope call tomorrow was annoying. So after telling my mom she had to start paying me back because I have nothing and at this time she started getting SSI she started to act funny. Making remarks like I am suppose to give her money on something or something else. I refused to give her money on rent, but the Light bill I was willing because we had agreement on that. However she wasn't paying the light bill either. And I did not want to give someone who borrows money from me and not pay bills, my money to pay a bill. I wanted to write a money order to PSE&G and pay them that way, when of course she was ready to pay the bill herself. That time never came, but smart remarks did. I was then making a plate of food and heading back to my room to do what I always have done when I heard her make a remark about me.  Oh wow I owe you, you owe me. This confused me because from what I know I don't owe her anything. I never borrowed from her at all. EVER. So I turned around to find out what she actually talking about. She then again tried to say she owes me but I owe her for the rent. I told her first off I don't owe you for rent. We had no discussion of me paying rent after you taking my name off lease. She already was saying who is and is not allowed to come in her house and if I had to pay rent she wouldn't at all be saying any of that, I allowed it because I was not paying rent. I then let her know, if I was to owe someone rent it wouldn't be you, it would be the landlord. She then asks me, with a sad expression kind of face, that aren't I going to help her move to PA. I said yea but what does that have to do with anything. She makes assumptions after which leads me to believe like she wanted me to give her all of the money I would be getting from unemployment if they finally give me it. This together with the I owe you you owe me thing made me really mad. It was again felt like people were telling me what I can or cant do with my things. I let her know again that I don't owe her anything she owes me and that I shouldn't have to say that I'm helping to move. Since I am moving too with her its a given. I then left and went back to my room but I notice she had a puzzled almost angry look on her face before leaving. The next day I would wake up to her texting me different calculations of things I would have to pay. I then let her know yea I would pay those things once you give me my money back. Because again I am not paying you it. I am paying the people the bill is for. That made her extremely mad. So she tried to say that I would now have to move out. Notice anything? So I said OK cool, I will. Ill find a place now and do that. So I started looking. She then told me she was not going to be paying her portion of the cable anymore and to shut it off. Hahaha. So I waited a bit, simply because I just didn't feel like it and then shut the cable off. I guess she forgot because this made her very angry. She then tried to turn off the power to my room, stating because I didn't give her any money for a light bill. This was funny to me because the amount of money she owed me she could of easily said well that parts for the light bill. But she didn't she just used it as an excuse whenever it suit her. Either I owed money for the light bill or I owed money for the rent, but the money she owed me always contributed to the other. Either way I had to give her all that money together and then I guess she would then pay me back? That was definitely not going to happen.   

&#x200B;

  
  After she turned the power off I turned it back on. So she decided to turn it off again and stand in front of it. Asserting her dominance I assume. The power going off and on actually breaks my computer. So I then would have to spend like 200 dollars replacing the part that broke. Back to the lights I wind up getting up and because the power box was open I reached behind her to turn my power back on. She then flinches and swats my hand away saying I lost my mind... When she puts her hands on me it angers me but I give her the benefit of the doubt because of the person I am and tells her she better not do it again. She then calls the cops and tells them I am acting erratic. I then call the cops later and ask them when they going to get here. The cops finally arrive and they start talking to each of us separately. At this time my cousin, well one of the ones who lived in the fancy house comes over. Seems my mother was calling everyone she could saying I put my hands on her. The police are talking to us both and I tell them exactly what happen. The police says yea y'all both just stay in y'all rooms and don't talk to each other. I was OK because that's what I already do so it didn't matter. She was so adamant on trying to have them arrest me though. To the point of starting to cry and saying she scared. The police didn't care, they even told her that because of COVID it was illegal to turn off my power and that If she did it again they would arrest her. They also told her that I lived her and that I couldn't be kicked out This definitely upset her because she changed her tune into Why would he do this when she has done so much for me and took care of me. I was really thrown back at this because it quite frankly wasn't true so I started to giggle. My cousin looks at me and then asks why am I laughing. I start to explain to her that I am laughing because people are lying, but before I can even finish letting the words come out my mouth she makes an I don't care hand gesture and walks away. At this point I'm like wow. So I'm like let me go ahead and look for a place to get the hell out of here. So what happens now is that because I wasn't arrested or kicked out it made my mother very mad. So she had a better idea. Since her name is on the lease she would just move out, thus I would definitely be kicked out because the tenant whose name on the lease doesn't live there. So I would be squatting. So she does just that. Now I am trying to take care of myself there. While also trying to not let stuff stress me because of the MS while also trying to find a place to move to. At this point my dad calls me out of nowhere. He doesn't like my mom so assumes everything he heard was lies and he wanted to hear it from me. He at that time was the only one who even asked me my side. No one else did. So I let him know and he tried to be there for me. It was different and it just felt like he somewhat cared so I cared a bit too. He was being told he had to leave his sister place as well. So I told him if he wanted to just move in with me and we get us a place together. He agreed and made a lot of big promises like being the one who cooks so I can eat healthier and stuff like that. Miraculously as well I finally got my unemployment money. The whole 7k so before I was going to use this to clear my debts because of stupid decisions I made trying to do drop shipping... But now I was going to use this for security deposit and rent. I felt pretty good now. I was looking for a place we could share. I wanted at least 2 bedrooms for myself so I was searching for a 3 bedroom. I was planning to give my dad the biggest bedroom because I would have 2 and we would be splitting the rent half way anyway. He tells me, you know I'm going to have the biggest bedroom right? This was a red flag but it was something I already was planning anyway so I didn't really care. So I said yes because I have two rooms and we both laughed about it. I would later have trouble continuing to look for a place because the landlord, or specifically the management did not want me there. Even though I told them my dad would come and we can start a new lease. Even if they wanted to raise the rent like they was trying to get at. They still did not want to let me stay. They even said that my mother told them I would pay the left over rent too before moving out. They then turned my power off and when I called police about it. The officers who came basically spoke to the lady on the phone out of listening range and then came back to me saying that they was not going to do anything because I was not suppose to be there. I then decided to at least charge my phone in hall way to get some power to keep looking for a place. I couldn't even shower either because the water was just too cold. The management would then screw close the hall way outlets so I couldn't use them. But I just unscrewed them back and used them. They would then call the cops on me but different officers came and said yea no and also y'all turning off his power was illegal. They told me I could sue if I wanted to but I just didn't care. I just wanted to leave already. I manage to find a place and after a bit we moved in. Day 1 of living in this new place my father already started complaining. He complained about how the place was since I was the only one to see it. Mind you this is my first time even getting a place myself and I really didn't know what to look for. I also didn't really want the place either but they were the only ones to accept me and I just wanted to leave and be able to shower in hot water.

  To get this place I used my own money to pay the security deposit and I payed the first months rent. Because my dad had nothing. He worked but he would bullshit his money on weed and cigs as well. So he never had any savings. So now he had to pay me back now for half a months rent. After we settled in I notice he was talking a lot to people about the place. It sounded almost as if I lived with him and not we both got this place. I was really confused too when he invited my sister over to see the place. And decided to just open my rooms door to let her see inside. Was very disrespectful to me but I let it slide. Later on he would tell me that I need to put all my stuff into one room just in case my sister wanted to come over to spend a night because she would need a room to be in. Now if you don't know me by now, yes this pissed me off. I didn't care if he said it in a joking matter. Just saying it pisses me off. How dare you. He then tries to tell me that the big bedroom is his. My bedroom where my bed is-is mine and the second room I have and everywhere else in the house is what we share. At this point I was questioning whether he was actually insane. I would later learn yes. He would then keep telling me things he heard is going on with my mom even though I didn't care about it since she was dead to me. He would then start to complain about how things were in the house and why I wasn't cleaning up. The problem with this is that everything that was dirty, was dirty because of him. He would spill coffee on the floor and leave to go to work, then get mad at me because I didn't clean it up. And his reasoning is that its because I am not doing anything anyway(since I wasn't working) That just didn't make sense to me so of course arguments would start. They would be, not too crazy but it would definitely be about the stupidest of things. At this point I knew it was a problem living with him. However he would always change his attitude like a day after, making me think OK maybe I can put up with him for awhile. All the bills are in my name as well and he would just assume how much it would be and send me money to pay it. However the money would not be enough so I would just add it on to what he owes me. He then would get mad when I told him he owed me for it going so far as to assume I'm lying and requesting I show him proof. I showed him proof and he still doesn't even care. But I just ignore it and tell him the math he doing is wrong. In fact the math he tried to do would make him owe me more money but I'm not going to let that happen. I wanted exactly what's owed, not less not more. So he says hell pay me back, I ask him when and he says he doesn't know....This pisses me off because its like saying you aren't. He doesn't even make an effort to pay me back per week either. So I'm stuck just hoping he pays me back. Currently we are 10 months into our 12 month lease and I have not been payed back a dime.   

&#x200B;

  
  In fact I don't think I will ever get payed back because a few days ago we got into a heated argument where we was going to fight. And I was hoping we did because I really wanted to let all the built up anger I had my entire life out on someone. However I don't trust these people and they are quick to call the cops and make up lies so I wanted him to at least go first so I can be the one defending myself. His excuse of not making the move was saying I would call the cops as well. Even though he was the one who first started saying he would put his hands on me. And this whole argument started because I asked him why he took my shampoo out of the bathroom. His reasoning was that it was his, that's why. I offered to show him receipts and I showed him his actual shampoo that he put in the bathroom along with another shampoo I purchased with my other one that were identical and different from his and he still didn't care. Started calling me names and making threats saying, only a bitch would keep receipts. HAHA I bought this shampoo literally 3 days ago. Of course I couldn't believe this and retaliated back with my own insults. I then told him if he feels that way he can just leave. He didn't give a security deposit, he didn't give first month rent, he not paying rent now because of a hole in ceiling that we wanted landlord to fix before we gave rent and he hasn't bothered to give me money for any of the other bills either. So I told him just leave. He basically responds with no u like the dummy he is. So basically I told him to shut up and stop talking to me. This was the end of the argument. Now I am currently trying to get a remote job once again and want to just make enough where I can just live by myself and at least leave this crappy expensive state. I don't want to be around these people at all and don't want them to even know where I am at. I have been trying my best to find any remote job. Even willing to take the dreaded tech support sales job. I am not getting any call backs though which is understandable based on my experience, which makes me regret not going to college. I don't even have enough to finish paying my portion of the lease. I hate it so much, and just wish I could go back in time and be my own father figure to myself to guide me on getting away from this much earlier. This is so frustrating and I'm sorry if it is long. I don't really have anyone to talk to and most people don't care. I can just tell by the look in their eyes. My brother even tried to tell me that I should forgive my mother even if I did go to jail. I cant stand it. I have been having thoughts but honestly I wouldn't even be able to go through with it unless it was super easy and quick. So I just forget about it. All I want now is just a job so I can just move. Sorry if this was long. This was the first time I threw out my problems and I just needed to vent. There's even a lot of stuff I didn't even say that makes people look far worse but this isn't about that its just me venting.

 I tend to be one who keeps things bottled up. However for my own mental health. I decided to just vent here about it. TL/DR at bottom. 



  
  So I have been having the worst life. I understand that people in Africa are probably a lot worse off but to my own standards, my life has just not been good. Starting from when I was young my school life was pretty horrible. I was constantly bullied and made fun of. The reason being was that my clothes were continuously smelling like marijuana. The bullying is what made me start to hate going to school. I would try to fake sick a lot, just to not go. Now you probably wondering why a child smelling like marijuana anyway? And after saying that you probably found the answer...My parents. That answer is why I absolutely hate weed and would never smoke it. They would smoke EVERY SINGLE DAY. Not giving a damn where they did it, or what they did it near. Thus brings in my uniform clothes. Being smoked up and me having to wear them the next day. I hated it so much.   
  Around the start of my 8th grade year. My family broke up because of my mother cheating. Her reasons for cheating, I don't really care about at this point. But after it happen my father decided to stop paying the rent to our apartment so we would lose it. We wind up moving to another city in a shitty basement. No rooms, had to separate the kids room and parents room with a blanket hanging up. I was then taking a train everyday to school to finish my 8th grade year. Lots of times I wouldn't even go home early, I would just try to chill with my older brother who lived with some people on the floor above our old apartment. I really enjoyed spending time with him and looked up to him. This made me happy so I did it a lot. At my graduation my parents got me a suit from someplace. But it was a weird silver suit that I was convinced into liking when I really didn't. What's worse is showing up to dance in that suit and seeing everyone wearing normal suits. Did not make me feel good, and made it worse when the next day at graduation everyone wore a different suit and I again wore that same suit.   
  I'm not sure what exactly happen over the summer but for some reason, I guess because of arguments, my mother decided to leave and take us and go stay with our cousins for like a week at their fancy big house in New Jersey. And then we went to a shelter after. This was a domestic violence shelter. Which I can tell you now, we definitely was taking a room from some actual survivor of DV. This would be the start of a trend because my high school life was also horrible. I went to a lot of different high schools because I basically lived shelter to shelter. My mother, my sister and I would go into a shelter, go out and have our own apartment, lose that apartment SOMEHOW??? and then be back in the shelter again. I also had to wear clothing the shelter gave us which just made me feel horrible. I slept a lot in school barely did work and was just fed up with how my life was at that point. I couldn't wait till I could get home and lose myself In my games. My high school graduation was no different then the first. Went to prom alone, with a suit and tie that was giving to me by the shelter system. Didn't even notice they gave me a tux shirt to wear with the suit jacket till I was at prom and someone pointed it out. Don't even know why I even went to it. Graduation same thing, same tuxedo suit.   



  
  When I graduated high school I thought it was time to finally be done with school in total so I decided not to pursue a college degree. This would later effect me big time. But at this time I really didn't know what I wanted to do. I wanted to do game design but I would try to learn it through little websites with their own silly little engines. I would run into problems though and everyone would be a complete asshole telling me to figure out the problem myself instead of just telling me what I did wrong. This cause me to quit that and I really didn't know what I wanted to do. It didn't help that I was constantly verbally abused by my father whenever he would visit my mom. Constantly being told what I should be doing with my life. Constantly being compared to my sister who decided to attend college. Constantly being told that I should attend a trade school and become a shitty ass mechanic. I've had arguments a lot with him about this. It was always just something with him. I also would like to point out that, and I'm sure most know, but when you live with a parent and you aren't working and you aren't paying bills either, they really really hate that. Something about you just existing just pisses them off for some reason, regardless if you just keep to yourself. So I basically had to force myself to get a job and I did. Wind up getting a nice lil job as a security guard. It was part time though but the pay was really good for a part time job. Was able to pay my own little bills, buy what I wanted. Bought the food I wanted to eat. Thought I was going to be able to maybe save up and just do whatever but the more I bought what I wanted the more I made people mad. Turns out that me working and buying what I want is just me wasting my money on foolish things. Turns out that me working this Security Job is also me being lazy because I wont get a job where I am constantly on my feet doing something....This will be a running theme later. 



  
  My brother winds up moving in with my mother and that later on causes problems. My mother who it seems wasn't even paying the rent at that time decided to move in with someone else leaving everyone at that apartment to fend for themselves. This was the first red flag I should of payed attention to. My sister was in a dorm, so she was OK. My brother was left there alone, and my father decided to take me in which he made sure to let me know that he didn't want to. My brother and I have different fathers so there wasn't really any hope for him. He winds up finding a place so that was good. When living with my dad it was horrible. He lived with his sister and his family obsessed over the smallest or stupid of things. Turning things that shouldn't be a problem into a problem. Like not coming out the room to greet whoever is in the kitchen with a good morning. Like what the hell? Or getting upset because someone is their internet when they aren't there. Going so far as to change the password on me. Silly things like this. Not to mention I was still working my security job at this time, So I had to commute 3 hours there and 3 hours back from New York to New Jersey. Just for a little bit of money. I also had a extra bill now, storage. I really didn't want to lose my things. So I put everything in storage. I would later take some things out of storage to use at his house which to my surprise was the worse thing because when I put my things in the storage, some of it got infested with bed bugs. So bringing the few things back to his place started a problem which I was definitely solely blamed for. Because I of course knew that there was bed bugs in it.... We manage to get rid of the bed bugs but didn't matter. My father would complain that I'm on my computer and not out doing something. We would have lots of arguments too because he would try to tell me when I can or cant use my things, and it was the most annoying thing ever. It would always just make my blood boil when someone who didn't contribute to what I have tells me what to do with it. This was again a red flag that I should of really remembered.   



  
  After constantly being blamed for things for no reason I was sick of living there. My mother called me and tried to borrow money from me because she was about to have nowhere to go. She was having problems with the person she moved in with and now that person decided they was just going to move and leave her there. This was ironic but also another red flag that for some reason I decided to let just pass me by. So me being the good guy, who also has problems with the people he living with decided that I would lend my money to her so she can use it as a security deposit and get us a place we can live together. I wind up staying at a hotel with her and going to work from there. At this time, she was a very supportive mother because I had helped her. You can kind of say she was at my beck and call, going so far to even wash my uniform clothes in the tub so that they would be clean. We wind up finding a small little one bedroom on Craigslist. I was told I would have the room, which was barely a room in fact the whole place would turn out to be illegal. She said she would have the living room as her room. It was basically like a reverse of the place we stayed at before she left my brother and I stranded. Things were fine so far. I was closer to my job again but this time a 30 minute commute to it and not 3 hours. My sister would start to live with us when it was school break, because colleges kick kids out their dorms on breaks??? Anyway, more people in the house now so of course more problems. My mother started complaining more about things. Things that, not only did it make no sense to complain about, but also it was things SHE DID. So it made 0 sense. She also needed to borrow money a lot for some reason, just for her habits. So she would constantly borrow from me. She borrowed a bit from my sister but my sister shut that down real quick after a point. She was smart, she saw the flags, I was a fool. So being the person I am I let her borrow money time and time again. And all I asked was that when I needed the money to please pay me back. I never rushed anyone to pay me back or anything like that. Just give me it when I need it. Well when you give people things it all good, but when its time to pay back...PROBLEMS. My mother happen to get some money, which I believe was income tax. At this point I was assuming she would pay me back. When I asked her about if she was going to, her response was, Once I pay you and your sister, I will have nothing left. Now this was strange and I am confused why this was said to me, but I'm not really sure how exactly that's my problem. I mean call me crazy but don't you borrow money because you need the money right then and there and cant wait to save up to use it? It would make total sense for you to now, after borrowing money, to use the new money you got to pay back the lender But I guess not. After arguments about it I was finally given a good amount of my money back, with the promise of paying the rest back. I was content so it didn't matter.   



  
  Now you are probably wondering why I posted this here. Well this part is where that answer comes. One day I happen to wake up and look in the mirror and half of my face is drooping. I wind up getting soap in my eyes too because of this, which effected my vision for awhile. So just remember to always look in the mirror before you shower. Anyway, called an ambulance went to hospital. Found out I had MS. I wasn't even mad really, since I was told Ill be kind of OK. Since they have all TYPES OF MEDICINES THESE DAYS WOOHOO. That is until you find out you have to take said medicine every single day for the rest of your life.... I already hate taking meds so this just really hit me hard. But I kept it to myself using my its whatever attitude. My mother tone changed as well. She was starting to and trying to do a lot of stuff for me. Which I really didn't enjoy because it felt like it was for show. Of course it was but I didn't really notice until I had the chance to think back on it. I was also starting to see the switch up. After awhile, me having MS was totally forgotten so everything went back to how it was. Arguments and complaints. When my mother and I first got this place, I had gotten internet only. I told my mom she would not need cable because anything on cable can be seen on the internet. She insisted to get cable as well and said she would pay the difference. I agreed. After a point she stop paying for the cable and made it into a tab. I didn't mind at the time because I again had a job and wasn't really paying much. However I would go on to lose that security job after four years. I then informed my mom, because of how high the cable and internet bill was, that she needs to give me something because this will eat into my savings eventually. Things still became a problem and I wind up turning the cable part off, which she wanted me to do, because she insisted that she doesn't need the cable either. However, when I did turn it off, this really upset her. This will also be a running theme. I was then told I need to find a place to move to because she was going to move with some old lady in a room in her apartment. Notice something? Anyway my sister was there and had just finished school. My sister was fed up with it as well so me and her both agreed to find us a place and live together and be away from the parent bullshit. My sister was working and I was looking for a place and a new job at the same time. My mother, seeing me go out constantly became very noisy. To the point where she inserted herself to come with me and my sister to see one of our places. And then would constantly try to find things wrong with the place so we wouldn't get it. She never even cared about this until she found out my sister and I would be living together. Not sure what she was thinking but after a while, out of nowhere, she suddenly found a 3 bedroom for us to move into together and split. Which I was fine with because I was not going to ever be paying rent for a place I'm living while also being told what I can and cant do in my own place. We decided on who gets what bedroom and signed the lease. Minutes after my mother would then try to take my bedroom and make me have hers, which was the littlest one. Which was not going to happen since we didn't agree on that. Red flag I definitely should of seen. 



  
  So at this point I am in this new place, my own room. I am currently taking Gilenya for my MS and I am about to start my new job. I felt like everything would start to get better. However it didn't. I thought this job was going to be purely tech support and I was ecstatic because I am a computer guy. I am about to get payed for something that I am constantly doing already. Nope. I do training and then am informed that the company I work for, well they basically loan their employees to other companies and I would have to work under their policies. And boy oh boy who do I get? Shitty Comcast. I hated them as a service and now I am going to have to work for them. I thought it would be OK at first until I was forced to get at least 3 sales a week. This might seem like nothing but for someone who turned down a sales job because they couldn't do it, this was a lot for me. Not only that but I was so used to just letting customers go after helping them with the reason they called. It was pretty hard for me to swindle these old people into upgrading their plans. I wind up getting headaches and stressing over it. It got to a point where as a work at home job I was calling out because I couldn't take just sitting at my PC and having to deal with it all. My headaches can also be contributed to the fact that I was no longer having any medication. When I was getting my medicine it was through Medicaid. And it turns out that If you make at least 1400 a month, then they was no longer going to cover you. I made 1600.. living wage in NJ is 2592. This makes a lot of sense to me. Anyway I had no medicine so I would have constant headaches. Things would easily cause them to come for me. I called out a lot. I needed some form of insurance to help cover this 9000 a month...medicine.. My job was at that moment not giving me insurance. I had to wait till the next Jan 1st to be covered. I was told to look into some type of charity insurance. I spoke to them however they would not cover me unless they got some proof from my job that they did not cover me. So I had to then run around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to figure out who am I suppose to speak to for this. I finally found the people and just my luck these people don't EVER answer phone calls or emails. So I'm sitting there constantly messaging them, Hey have you got my message? Hoping they would reply. This just added onto the stress. I was written up a lot for missing days also. Its funny because I should of known this would happen when I missed a day for my training to go to the doctor and they decided it was inexcusable and made me no longer entitled to the 50 cent extra an hour raise after training ends... Because of the days I missed ,I wind up getting fired. THE DAY AFTER I WAS FIRED I WAS FINALLY MESSAGED BY THE INSURANCE PEOPLE!! They told me that because I no longer worked for them I could not get the insurance.... This absolutely made my blood boil. I then came back to Medicaid and was able to get insurance again. I went with the plan they provided me because it seemed a bit fancy. They was talking about housing and food and all of that stuff. Problem with that though, is that they was not covering my Gilenya. They said yea no, that medicine waaay too expensive. So after taking a few months to even find this out. I decided to switch back to my old plan from Medicaid that did cover it.   



  
  So at this point my neurologist said, Since you have these problems with coverage and taking medicine I don't want to put you on to medicine and then you later are no longer able to take it. So I will try to put you onto Maven Clad which you wont have to take everyday for the rest of your life. I said OK that sounds really good. I just had to wait now for my insurance to cover it... haha they wont. They absolutely refused. They wanted me to take Gilenya or any other of the daily medicines again. They wanted me to try at least 5 medicines including Gilenya which I don't see how they don't even understand I took Gilenya already. But they wanted me to try the 5 first and if they DONT WORK, then I can use Maven Clad. The problem with this is that it wasn't about them not working. It was about me not being able to get them anymore. So I had to wait and wait and wait. I was on unemployment after this. And the company I worked for decided to fight against me saying I don't deserve unemployment because I broke the rules,(needing to come to work no exceptions.) I had to go against them myself not knowing anything and ultimately I lose. I could of did the whole fight back but after seeing I would only just lose like 2 thousand and can still get unemployment I decided to just let it go. I didn't want to deal with it anymore. Around the time I had about 3 months left on my unemployment COVID happen. I was absolutely terrified of COVID and did not want to get it. I assume with my MS, it was a death sentence. The bright side of this was unemployment increasing 600 dollars. Unfortunately my unemployment was about to run out anyway so it didn't matter too much. The extra pay was nice though. To be honest, I can probably deal with a stressful Job if I'm making 900 a week from it. That's life changing money for someone like me. Alas, it was then decreased to 300 dollars. OK cool that's still fine. I'm still paying my bills and other things with it. After that my unemployment ended. I was trying to get an extension for it. I really messed up here because I should of kept looking for a job. I wanted one remotely but did not want to have to do a job that was tech support and sales. And it seems like almost all jobs that don't require degrees, are tech support and sales mixed in one. Turns out more experience you have, the less work you have to do. Crazy. Anyway I put myself in a jam. I was only doing the minimum require to find a job to continue getting unemployment. Just in case. And I was making way more on unemployment then I did working anyway so why try to work when employers wont offer more. So after COVID happen my mother lost her job. She was using savings to pay rent too and her savings was going very low. She I believe quit because of a fall or something like that. So she couldn't get unemployment. She started borrowing money from the only person she could. Me. Which I gave her. At a certain point my sister had problems with living with us. It was because of things that my mom was known for and she didn't want to be near me anymore because I wouldn't clean the bathroom when she wanted me to. We had rules but a lot of times I would get headaches and not do what I was suppose to at that time. I would do it like a day after or something. Either way after a point she got really mad about this and an argument started. So she decided to move out at the end of the lease. My mother had the galls to try to say I was the one who should move out. So I said sure okay. However my sister didn't want to live with her either. So when she said she still moving out my mother changed her tune again quick fast. Trying to make it seem as if she didn't mean anything by what she said. Because it was me and my mom now we had to split the rent between us now. Which would be a lot. However, my mother decided to get government assistance so that they could pay the rent. The problem with this is that I was there. They was not going to help pay unless I moved out. So my mother acted as if I was not there anymore, and contacted the landlords to take my name off the lease. Making it solely in her name. I really regret me allowing this to happen but I didn't know any better at the time. Moving on, my mother was still in talks with them along with borrowing money from me. Money for weed, money for cigarettes, it would just keep adding up and up. Till a point where she would owe me somewhere of 4k.   



  
  There was a thing saying I'm allowed an extension on my unemployment. It would also give me 300 per weak as well if I could get it. In total this would be a lot of money for me. Around 6-7k. I let my mom know about it and she was all in. With her getting her money and mine. They plan was to get a place in like PA. And I get a job again save up without having to pay rent and I save up. This was a cool plan but the way she described it was as if I would be staying there for a looong time. I did not want this. I wanted to have my own place with no one around. I was especially tired of coming out my room to smell weed smoke all the time anyway. At this time of living here the rent was not being payed and was piling up. The assistance people decided now they would help since my mother was By her self The only problem is that they found out my mother was getting some type of big money and they said she would need to pay them back. So she got upset about this and basically blamed me saying I should be paying some of that back to her. I didn't agree because that's not of anything what we discussed. Besides I'm not sure how you would get to take my name off lease for assistance but I would need to pay back when you wouldn't get that assistance if my name wasn't removed in the first place. Going back on words was also a running theme. My savings again would start to run low and I would tell my mom she needs to start trying to pay me back. Give me something anything. We had the old cable set up again and of course she wasn't giving me money for that. I also was not getting any unemployment. I couldn't even get in contact with anyone. It would always just say call again tomorrow. Waking up early to call them just for them to say nope call tomorrow was annoying. So after telling my mom she had to start paying me back because I have nothing and at this time she started getting SSI she started to act funny. Making remarks like I am suppose to give her money on something or something else. I refused to give her money on rent, but the Light bill I was willing because we had agreement on that. However she wasn't paying the light bill either. And I did not want to give someone who borrows money from me and not pay bills, my money to pay a bill. I wanted to write a money order to PSE&G and pay them that way, when of course she was ready to pay the bill herself. That time never came, but smart remarks did. I was then making a plate of food and heading back to my room to do what I always have done when I heard her make a remark about me.  Oh wow I owe you, you owe me. This confused me because from what I know I don't owe her anything. I never borrowed from her at all. EVER. So I turned around to find out what she actually talking about. She then again tried to say she owes me but I owe her for the rent. I told her first off I don't owe you for rent. We had no discussion of me paying rent after you taking my name off lease. She already was saying who is and is not allowed to come in her house and if I had to pay rent she wouldn't at all be saying any of that, I allowed it because I was not paying rent. I then let her know, if I was to owe someone rent it wouldn't be you, it would be the landlord. She then asks me, with a sad expression kind of face, that aren't I going to help her move to PA. I said yea but what does that have to do with anything. She makes assumptions after which leads me to believe like she wanted me to give her all of the money I would be getting from unemployment if they finally give me it. This together with the I owe you you owe me thing made me really mad. It was again felt like people were telling me what I can or cant do with my things. I let her know again that I don't owe her anything she owes me and that I shouldn't have to say that I'm helping to move. Since I am moving too with her its a given. I then left and went back to my room but I notice she had a puzzled almost angry look on her face before leaving. The next day I would wake up to her texting me different calculations of things I would have to pay. I then let her know yea I would pay those things once you give me my money back. Because again I am not paying you it. I am paying the people the bill is for. That made her extremely mad. So she tried to say that I would now have to move out. Notice anything? So I said OK cool, I will. Ill find a place now and do that. So I started looking. She then told me she was not going to be paying her portion of the cable anymore and to shut it off. Hahaha. So I waited a bit, simply because I just didn't feel like it and then shut the cable off. I guess she forgot because this made her very angry. She then tried to turn off the power to my room, stating because I didn't give her any money for a light bill. This was funny to me because the amount of money she owed me she could of easily said well that parts for the light bill. But she didn't she just used it as an excuse whenever it suit her. Either I owed money for the light bill or I owed money for the rent, but the money she owed me always contributed to the other. Either way I had to give her all that money together and then I guess she would then pay me back? That was definitely not going to happen.   



  
  After she turned the power off I turned it back on. So she decided to turn it off again and stand in front of it. Asserting her dominance I assume. The power going off and on actually breaks my computer. So I then would have to spend like 200 dollars replacing the part that broke. Back to the lights I wind up getting up and because the power box was open I reached behind her to turn my power back on. She then flinches and swats my hand away saying I lost my mind... When she puts her hands on me it angers me but I give her the benefit of the doubt because of the person I am and tells her she better not do it again. She then calls the cops and tells them I am acting erratic. I then call the cops later and ask them when they going to get here. The cops finally arrive and they start talking to each of us separately. At this time my cousin, well one of the ones who lived in the fancy house comes over. Seems my mother was calling everyone she could saying I put my hands on her. The police are talking to us both and I tell them exactly what happen. The police says yea y'all both just stay in y'all rooms and don't talk to each other. I was OK because that's what I already do so it didn't matter. She was so adamant on trying to have them arrest me though. To the point of starting to cry and saying she scared. The police didn't care, they even told her that because of COVID it was illegal to turn off my power and that If she did it again they would arrest her. They also told her that I lived her and that I couldn't be kicked out This definitely upset her because she changed her tune into Why would he do this when she has done so much for me and took care of me. I was really thrown back at this because it quite frankly wasn't true so I started to giggle. My cousin looks at me and then asks why am I laughing. I start to explain to her that I am laughing because people are lying, but before I can even finish letting the words come out my mouth she makes an I don't care hand gesture and walks away. At this point I'm like wow. So I'm like let me go ahead and look for a place to get the hell out of here. So what happens now is that because I wasn't arrested or kicked out it made my mother very mad. So she had a better idea. Since her name is on the lease she would just move out, thus I would definitely be kicked out because the tenant whose name on the lease doesn't live there. So I would be squatting. So she does just that. Now I am trying to take care of myself there. While also trying to not let stuff stress me because of the MS while also trying to find a place to move to. At this point my dad calls me out of nowhere. He doesn't like my mom so assumes everything he heard was lies and he wanted to hear it from me. He at that time was the only one who even asked me my side. No one else did. So I let him know and he tried to be there for me. It was different and it just felt like he somewhat cared so I cared a bit too. He was being told he had to leave his sister place as well. So I told him if he wanted to just move in with me and we get us a place together. He agreed and made a lot of big promises like being the one who cooks so I can eat healthier and stuff like that. Miraculously as well I finally got my unemployment money. The whole 7k so before I was going to use this to clear my debts because of stupid decisions I made trying to do drop shipping... But now I was going to use this for security deposit and rent. I felt pretty good now. I was looking for a place we could share. I wanted at least 2 bedrooms for myself so I was searching for a 3 bedroom. I was planning to give my dad the biggest bedroom because I would have 2 and we would be splitting the rent half way anyway. He tells me, you know I'm going to have the biggest bedroom right? This was a red flag but it was something I already was planning anyway so I didn't really care. So I said yes because I have two rooms and we both laughed about it. I would later have trouble continuing to look for a place because the landlord, or specifically the management did not want me there. Even though I told them my dad would come and we can start a new lease. Even if they wanted to raise the rent like they was trying to get at. They still did not want to let me stay. They even said that my mother told them I would pay the left over rent too before moving out. They then turned my power off and when I called police about it. The officers who came basically spoke to the lady on the phone out of listening range and then came back to me saying that they was not going to do anything because I was not suppose to be there. I then decided to at least charge my phone in hall way to get some power to keep looking for a place. I couldn't even shower either because the water was just too cold. The management would then screw close the hall way outlets so I couldn't use them. But I just unscrewed them back and used them. They would then call the cops on me but different officers came and said yea no and also y'all turning off his power was illegal. They told me I could sue if I wanted to but I just didn't care. I just wanted to leave already. I manage to find a place and after a bit we moved in. Day 1 of living in this new place my father already started complaining. He complained about how the place was since I was the only one to see it. Mind you this is my first time even getting a place myself and I really didn't know what to look for. I also didn't really want the place either but they were the only ones to accept me and I just wanted to leave and be able to shower in hot water.   



  
  To get this place I used my own money to pay the security deposit and I payed the first months rent. Because my dad had nothing. He worked but he would bullshit his money on weed and cigs as well. So he never had any savings. So now he had to pay me back now for half a months rent. After we settled in I notice he was talking a lot to people about the place. It sounded almost as if I lived with him and not we both got this place. I was really confused too when he invited my sister over to see the place. And decided to just open my rooms door to let her see inside. Was very disrespectful to me but I let it slide. Later on he would tell me that I need to put all my stuff into one room just in case my sister wanted to come over to spend a night because she would need a room to be in. Now if you don't know me by now, yes this pissed me off. I didn't care if he said it in a joking matter. Just saying it pisses me off. How dare you. He then tries to tell me that the big bedroom is his. My bedroom where my bed is-is mine and the second room I have and everywhere else in the house is what we share. At this point I was questioning whether he was actually insane. I would later learn yes. He would then keep telling me things he heard is going on with my mom even though I didn't care about it since she was dead to me. He would then start to complain about how things were in the house and why I wasn't cleaning up. The problem with this is that everything that was dirty, was dirty because of him. He would spill coffee on the floor and leave to go to work, then get mad at me because I didn't clean it up. And his reasoning is that its because I am not doing anything anyway(since I wasn't working) That just didn't make sense to me so of course arguments would start. They would be, not too crazy but it would definitely be about the stupidest of things. At this point I knew it was a problem living with him. However he would always change his attitude like a day after, making me think OK maybe I can put up with him for awhile. All the bills are in my name as well and he would just assume how much it would be and send me money to pay it. However the money would not be enough so I would just add it on to what he owes me. He then would get mad when I told him he owed me for it going so far as to assume I'm lying and requesting I show him proof. I showed him proof and he still doesn't even care. But I just ignore it and tell him the math he doing is wrong. In fact the math he tried to do would make him owe me more money but I'm not going to let that happen. I wanted exactly what's owed, not less not more. So he says hell pay me back, I ask him when and he says he doesn't know....This pisses me off because its like saying you aren't. He doesn't even make an effort to pay me back per week either. So I'm stuck just hoping he pays me back. Currently we are 10 months into our 12 month lease and I have not been payed back a dime.   



  
  In fact I don't think I will ever get payed back because a few days ago we got into a heated argument where we was going to fight. And I was hoping we did because I really wanted to let all the built up anger I had my entire life out on someone. However I don't trust these people and they are quick to call the cops and make up lies so I wanted him to at least go first so I can be the one defending myself. His excuse of not making the move was saying I would call the cops as well. Even though he was the one who first started saying he would put his hands on me. And this whole argument started because I asked him why he took my shampoo out of the bathroom. His reasoning was that it was his, that's why. I offered to show him receipts and I showed him his actual shampoo that he put in the bathroom along with another shampoo I purchased with my other one that were identical and different from his and he still didn't care. Started calling me names and making threats saying, only a bitch would keep receipts. HAHA I bought this shampoo literally 3 days ago. Of course I couldn't believe this and retaliated back with my own insults. I then told him if he feels that way he can just leave. He didn't give a security deposit, he didn't give first month rent, he not paying rent now because of a hole in ceiling that we wanted landlord to fix before we gave rent and he hasn't bothered to give me money for any of the other bills either. So I told him just leave. He basically responds with no u like the dummy he is. So basically I told him to shut up and stop talking to me. This was the end of the argument. Now I am currently trying to get a remote job once again and want to just make enough where I can just live by myself and at least leave this crappy expensive state. I don't want to be around these people at all and don't want them to even know where I am at. I have been trying my best to find any remote job. Even willing to take the dreaded tech support sales job. I am not getting any call backs though which is understandable based on my experience, which makes me regret not going to college. I don't even have enough to finish paying my portion of the lease. I hate it so much, and just wish I could go back in time and be my own father figure to myself to guide me on getting away from this much earlier. This is so frustrating and I'm sorry if it is long. I don't really have anyone to talk to and most people don't care. I can just tell by the look in their eyes. My brother even tried to tell me that I should forgive my mother even if I did go to jail. I cant stand it. I have been having thoughts but honestly I wouldn't even be able to go through with it unless it was super easy and quick. So I just forget about it. All I want now is just a job so I can just move. Sorry if this was long. This was the first time I threw out my problems and I just needed to vent. There's even a lot of stuff I didn't even say that makes people look far worse but this isn't about that its just me venting. Thanks for reading I only have to say if any family members giving you a hard time. Make plans to stay away immediately. There is no law that forces you to talk to family members and don't let them guilt trip you into thinking you owe them anything. No one is brought into this world by their own choice.   

  
  You don't owe anyone anything for being on this planet.   

  
  TL/DR Family can be the biggest detriment to your health. Stay away from toxic family members and don't give them a chance to ruin you."

I am still waiting to get put on medication. Only on one and it doesn't help pain flare up just kidneys.

I take acetaminophen but hardly helps, I cannot take NSAIDS due to gastritis and a medication interaction, heating pad helps a little, ice packs help a little. My weighted blanket makes me feel cozy at least.

I can't shower because it's too painful.

Is there anything else I'm missing?

I'm so confused by lupus. I was dx this summer and just had some joint pain to start with. These last two weeks have been awful for me though. Could barely walk from pain, low grade fevers, and my lower back feels like someone is just punching me over and over again. My rheumatologist put me on a tapered dose of prednisone that helped at first, but once the dose lowered, the pain got bad again. My pcp uped my dose of prednisone, but my question is - is this how it's going to be with lupus? Where you get to barely functioning and there isn't a whole lot you can about it?
O, also, I only sleep until about 2 in the morning, and docs don't seem helpful with that either. This sucks!","New to lupus /already done with it

Hey all! So Im going to make this as condensed as possible, I think my reasoning for this post is just basic discussion and other peoples experience if any.

I have anxiety, Ive HAD anxiety pretty much all my life even before my CF was a real issue in my life. Basically Im at a point now where Ive had more issues with the disease since I cultured pseudomonas and MAC Avium a year ago which was caused me a lot more anxiety.

I have symptoms like shortness of breath, tight chest, heavy feeling in chest, feeling like I cant breathe all that fun anxiety stuff. The problem with this is I dont know if Im having a flare up or if its just anxiety. It happens around the same time everyday and even after the attack is over I still dont feel well the rest of the day. 

Also my team knows about this and so do my doctors I do not hide my anxiety and I do have coping mechanisms it has just been more harder recently. So thats pretty much it. Feel free to rant or discuss down below if you guys would like, just needed to vent a bit I guess.","CF and Anxiety

My lupus is active - this is the first time my condition has been concerning enough that I'm in the process currently of introductory benlysta infusions - I've had two this far...  basically an infusion every two weeks for the first 3 doses and then move to monthly basis.  I'm also on plaquenil.  I also have steroid topicals for rash.    


Currently symptoms are...  malar rash, some stiffness and joint pain but that seems to be easing up.  Had low platelets so easy to bruise, but not low enough to be concerning such as bleeding etc.  No evidence of Kidney activity or any other organs thus far.    


Before starting benlysta I was on a round of prednisone and did topicals for my rash and it cleared up some.  discontinued the steroids just prior to my covid booster shot and 2 weeks after that started the benlysta.    


My rash is coming back - so I'm starting up the topicals again.  This morning while we're getting ready for work he points out that my rash is getting worse and asks me if I'm taking my medication and I got defensive about it.  Yes I know he's worried...  like I'm worried too...  but I explained that his questioning like that made me feel like he was blaming me for my symptoms.

Except the little flickers and sound distortions and stuff, I rarely have hallucinations during the day, but when those occur they are usually prominent and external.... but a lot of the time before I take my meds in the morning I also have hallucinations. They can be on my way out of my room, or while in bed, eyes open or closed (I often like to try falling back asleep for a couple more hours since I have poor sleep).... Today it was like I looked up at the ceiling and there were 3 different voices, talking internally, even talking over my inner voice.

I may likely be adding more to this as the brain fog continues to wear off and the process of making thoughts and feelings more coherent is easier if a task.

Syncope happened at approx 7:05 am.

- [ ] EMT at ER did the orthoststic testing (sitting, standing, laying down, BP - I asked for HR to be included) 
- [ ] My sitting was approx 95 hr, standing was 130 HR, with BP stayed about the same. I asked if it was normal to rise so much. EMT Jay said yeah that was normal. Me: a thirty beat jump is normal? EMT Jay: well normally its more like 10. Are you on beta blocker? Me: no 

- [ ] The doctor came in to tell me I was being diagnosed with dehydration and malnutrition.

(This after I was told early on that this is a teaching hospital and that the doctor will likely ask the same questions as the phys assit. already asked so I was anticipating more of a conversation or discussion)
- [ ] However when the physician assistant came in to walk me through all the results from all the testing my blood work came back not severely/seriously dehydrated .
- [ ] They had sussed that I was dehydrated because when they did the orthoststic test / (poor mans tilt table test) my heart rate jumped up 30-35 points beteeen sitting and standing. 
- [ ] I asked them that Given that summation, that I was curious about a redo of the orthoststic reading following the IV bag of fluids. 
- [ ] Right before I was discharged the nurse had me stand up for the vitals  I went to sit down and he said that wasnt necessary they only needed to get the standing.

Hi all 

I can see only one post on this from 3 years ago so it would be great to hear from you. 

Im 28F with IBS D. Officially diagnosed 4-5 years ago but had symptoms for years before. I recently realised I have learnt to live with my symptoms and just put up with the urgency, pain, bloating, gassiness... I have taken peppermint oil tablets and deflatine on ad hoc occasions when Ive been bloated. They help a bit but not loads.

Anyway - the question! Ive seen a bit about probiotics online and Aflorex has mostly good reviews and scientific backing.

Have you tried Aflorex? How did you get on? Or have you tried any other probiotics? Im worried about any initial side effects too.

My right eye seems to twitch/jerk a lot. A lot of times pretty much every day. Sometimes its barely noticeable and sometimes its bad enough to where it literally causes my eye to shut. I feel like rubbing my eye helps it go away. I asked my doctor if this is related to my seizures because back in 2006 I had my first TC seizure out of nowhere while I saw sleeping. Since then Ive only had about 7-8 TC seizures and theyve all been while Im asleep. I wake up to that twitching feeling but within seconds I go into the seizure. 

I asked my doctor if the eye twitching is related to the seizures to which she seems to be full blown confident they arent. I only asked because I dont understand why I get that same feeling before a seizure. During the day I can get the eye twitching multiple times a day but Im in control of myself. Other than people who might notice it and think Im winking at them. 

Ive had a eeg that I took home and wore for a week and the eye twitching happened throughout the week but nothing showed up on the results. So maybe they arent? I also asked if they could be partial seizure but she also doubted that. Basically saying if my eye twitching is constantly happening and I dont have a seizure she doesnt see how they could be related. 

Its just confusing because she doesnt really seem too concerned. Im on medication to avoid the TC seizures at night but I dont understand why I would feel that weird eye twitching right before the TCs when I was having them.","Eye twitching and seizures

1262,ss5grf,t5_2s3g1,"I have no hope left thanks to my IBS [TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS]
Welp, I was diagnosed with IBS 2 years ago and it has slowly gotten worse over time. I have tried many different medications, diets, therapies/exercises and herbal remedies which I've listed below with no relief or change in symptoms. I have not left my house in 3 months, apart from to see doctors and specialists who basically shrug their shoulders at me and tell me they don't know what else to do.

my symptoms include, stomach cramps, sharp pains in intestines, pain around butthole, blood in stool, diarrhoea one minute and extreme constipation the next, numbness and constant pain in my legs and lower back that make it difficult for me to walk, goose bumps all over my entire body when in pain, pain and elevated symptoms during any kind of exercise, I am extremely underweight, Lack of control over bowel causing me to have accidents, my stomach gurgles constantly and is super loud, I also pass massive amounts of clear mucous with most of my bowel movements during the day/night being only this clear/yellow mucous (I generally go to the bathroom 20-30 times a day).

Every single time I wake up I wish I hadn't the pain and discomfort is constant with the only relief being sleep or sitting in a boiling hot bath for hours on end. I used to be a very active person, I loved running, hung out with friends daily, I was always out at car meets and camped/hiked on weekends. I can no longer do any of those things. I feel like a shell of the person I used to be. Everything I used to take for granted is so hard for me to do now.

As I mentioned above my symptoms have gotten more severe over time and slowly all of my friends have disappeared. I watched as my flare up days got closer and closer together until everyday was the same amount of pain no matter what I did or ate. Visits to the ER, specialists, dieticians and doctors got more frequent, I could no longer go to car meets as my pains got worse at night, I couldn't go clubbing or out for food because I was on a FODMAP diet and in too much pain to go anyways. I spent more and more time alone at home suffering and less and less of my 'friends' checked up on me. Any plans I tried to make were ruined by my IBS and No one ever rocked up when I invited them over so I could be near a toilet. The excuses for not seeing me or texting back got lamer and lamer until I realised that they just didn't want to see me. I was always a shoulder to cry on while I was well, I planned group days out, paid for trips together, had surprise parties for friends having a rough time but when I needed someone, literally anyone, they weren't there.

My days are spent alone, sat at my desk studying for a mechanics certification. It is now the second time I am attempting to pass this course ( 1 semester long), not because its hard but because I didn't have high enough attendance due my IBS. I am the star student of my class with perfect notes and put the most effort into my work as I possibly can (it is my main source of entertainment) yet after all the time I've put in I am back where I started. This year I have been accommodated for much more and now I don't have to go into class often. although these accommodations are helpful the truth is that I can't last a day at TAFE so how am I supposed to hold down a job as a mechanic in the future.

I really cant be bothered to write anymore i've told so many therapists, doctors ect. this same story and there are so many shitty parts about having IBS that I haven't even mentioned yet. I just wish there was a painless escape for me. I've attempted suicide many times before and obviously I'm still here. At this point all an attempt means is a trip to the psych ward so I've stopped bothering, but the thoughts are always there. Any time I run out of things to do the crying starts. I'm alone in my 2 bedroom flat every day, no job, disability money, can barely afford all my medication, the people I care about are gone, no one will hire me due to my IBS making me unreliable and I feel like i've been cheated. this is not the life I wanted, this is not who I want to be. 

list of all medications tried:

amitriptyline, Ibergast, mebeverine, buscopan, immodium, fiber supliments, peppermint capsules, paracetamol for osteoporosis patients, codine (worked a little but there's a risk of narcotic bowel syndrome), essential oils, gut focused yoga, pain management therapy (weekly), gut meditation, numbing cream (for pain around my butthole TMI I know), FODMAP, lactose-free, gluten-free etc.,","I have no hope left thanks to my IBS [TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDAL THOUGHTS]

1268,rx9ygs,t5_2tyg2,"Question regarding my brother
Hello, I hope that my question is rightly placed here. 
My brother is okay now but I still think about his delusions and I don't know what form of mental health problem was involved there. 
A few years ago my brother got a new job after he was unemployed for around a year. He quit his last job because the business did illegal stuff. He was at the univeristy and I think it was stressful for him to be unemployed that long. 
I am way younger than him. When I was born he was a teenager. But when I grew older we did a lot of stuff together. We also both did drugs and while he was unemployed his drug use got more intense. We did everything from weed to psychedelics to stuff like opioids. This maybe contributed to his state at the time. 

When he started his new job he was excited but he soon started to worry. He thought his drug use may could lead to him loosing his job. And soon he would think that the people at his job spy on him in order to get him into prison. In our country drug use is decriminalized and my brother knew that but he still thought that the police is working together with his colleagues to get him into prison. He thought the people will record what he talks about to find something that will get him into prison. He started to record his colleagues with his smartphone. He listened to what they said and searched for prove that he was right. One time after work a colleague smoked a joint and asked him if he wants to join. My brother did smoke with him because he thought that this guy may be not part of the conspiracy against him. Later he thought that this guy was from the police and recorded him smoking weed. 
He talked openly about this situation with our family. Most people told him that he was delusional but he would not listen. 
After a few months I got him to contact a therapist and this really helped him. 

Later he told me that this was not the first time he thought people planned a conspiracy against him. When I was 16 my friends often chilled at my parents house. My brother thought that we talk bad about him which we never did. One day he was drunk and me and some friends talked to him. He suddenly went into rage mode and beat the shit out of me while my friends were hiding. 
He told me that he thought that we were planning something against him. 

Does this sound like some form of reaccuring psychosis thing? Or like another mental health problem? He is good now and it does not seem like he experiences something like that now. 
His therapist told him that his symptoms are normal but for me he seemed pretty delusional.","Question regarding my brother

Taking a sip of water helps abate the symptoms. The doctors I have spoken to think it could be a result of low blood volume causing my body to trigger my brain to tell me to intake fluids. I drink about 2.5 liters of water a day and I cant do anything or go anywhere without water. Does anyone else experience this?","Feel I like I MUST drink water even though Im hydrated with POTS.

Hey everyone, I was wondering if someone could advise on moving to a different country (Canada - UK) and being covered under their heathcare system. I can get a spousal visa for the UK through my husband and we were planning to move to the UK for a while but I was diagnosed with MS last year which has complicated things.  
  
My BC Canadian health benefits are pretty good, I am on DMT at the moment (Tecfidera), everything is paid for by public healthcare and I see my MS doctor every 6 months and they seem very supportive.  
  
In the UK I am not sure if I would be covered to the same level of care, would I have to pay privately , is there an easy process to follow and would they even approve my visa if I have MS?

Hi all, 

I know that in the grand scheme of epilepsy this is not a big deal, but I've started losing my hair. I had no problems with my hair before starting AEDs, and there aren't any bald men in my family. My father is the worst with a receding hairline. 

I've started losing mine right above my hairline and at the crown of my head, and it has been fairly rapid over the last year. 

Did I mention I'm under 35? 

Anyway, I did a quick google and apparently Topamax causes hair loss in about 5% of people. Greaaat. 

I've tried Rogaine, and while I'll admit I wasn't the most diligent with it didn't see any results.

Hi everyone...

Was hoping to reach out here and see if anyone can provide assistance for my father - 

He is 68 years old (2022) and has been epileptic since age 13 due to traumatic brain injury. He has been on seizure medication ever since which now include Keppra, Vimpat, and Depakote - he takes about 1500mg every 12 hours (9am and 9pm). This short term memory is completely gone - doesn't remember when I am home, where he has been, what city he lives in, etc. It seems like his petite seizures have increased without change in medication (they can't give him anymore, he is maxed out). When he goes into this petite seizure, its like a form of dementia, but he will get stiff, shakes in his right hand, gazes out.. and he isn't coming out of them like he used to. As of today, 1/4/2022, he has refused to take his medication because he is being very combative. He tried biting himself, he is lashing out at my husband, my mother and I. He doesn't make sense, keeps repeating the words ""yes"" ""no"" ""it's ok"" but it is slurred.. almost like a stroke, but not. The episode started around 6:30pm last night and as of now 11:20am PST the next day, he is asleep, but urinated in the laundry room thinking he was in the bathroom. I am still unable to get him to take his medication and he is still in the hazy state of seizing. It is possible that he is continuing to have multiple petite seizures due to not taking his meds (he needs his meds or will seize within hours) he has NOT had a grand mal seizure as of yet, but I would assume that is coming given he has been without medication for over 24hrs. 

&#x200B;

The doctors have no answers and I am running out of options on how he needs to be treated. Not everyday is bad, but the petite seizure/dementia has been occurring at least every 2-3 months. Usually seizures decrease with age, but he is doing the opposite.

Any help, guidance, treatment options, long term care assistance is appreciated. I just don't know where to turn anymore..","HELP PLEASE! Father with Epilepsy and on-set dementia and on three medications every 12 hours...for over 50 years.
Hi everyone...

Was hoping to reach out here and see if anyone can provide assistance for my father - 

He is 68 years old (2022) and has been epileptic since age 13 due to traumatic brain injury. He has been on seizure medication ever since which now include Keppra, Vimpat, and Depakote - he takes about 1500mg every 12 hours (9am and 9pm). This short term memory is completely gone - doesn't remember when I am home, where he has been, what city he lives in, etc. It seems like his petite seizures have increased without change in medication (they can't give him anymore, he is maxed out). When he goes into this petite seizure, its like a form of dementia, but he will get stiff, shakes in his right hand, gazes out.. and he isn't coming out of them like he used to. As of today, 1/4/2022, he has refused to take his medication because he is being very combative. He tried biting himself, he is lashing out at my husband, my mother and I. He doesn't make sense, keeps repeating the words ""yes"" ""no"" ""it's ok"" but it is slurred.. almost like a stroke, but not. The episode started around 6:30pm last night and as of now 11:20am PST the next day, he is asleep, but urinated in the laundry room thinking he was in the bathroom. I am still unable to get him to take his medication and he is still in the hazy state of seizing. It is possible that he is continuing to have multiple petite seizures due to not taking his meds (he needs his meds or will seize within hours) he has NOT had a grand mal seizure as of yet, but I would assume that is coming given he has been without medication for over 24hrs. 



The doctors have no answers and I am running out of options on how he needs to be treated. Not everyday is bad, but the petite seizure/dementia has been occurring at least every 2-3 months. Usually seizures decrease with age, but he is doing the opposite.

I started Allo around 2.5 months ago now, originally I was sceptical as at 32 years old I hated the idea of taking a pill every day for the rest of my life. 

I started on 100mg but was still getting flares that were stopped dead by the colchicine. After my blood test a month later I insisted I up my dose as my UI Serum level was still at 7. 

Since moving to 200mg Ive had no twinges, Ive eaten brisket and drank IPAs (my 2 biggest triggers) and had zero reaction! Its incredible. 

For anyone who is doubting Allo, I say so it, it will change your life!","Allo is a life changer!

Hey guys! Just a quick question: 

How do you feel when youre bloated? More specifically after eating trigger foods. 

For example, today I ate a small piece of sourdough bread and I have intense bloating/ feeling full around the belly area. It feels like period cramps but I know its not my period. I feel more heaviness towards one side of my abdomen, cramping when I pee or move. 

In the past Ive gone to the ER and had scans done to rule our appendicitis or ovarian cysts or the like. So I know with confidence is not either of those. 

Im just curious if others experience similar bloating symptoms or how does it feel for you??","Bloating. Help

Sorry, I am completely new to this and dont know how to properly abbreviate this. From everything I have researched, this is a rare mutation and specific to a region that I am from (could be wrong, but there is just not a lot of info I found on this mutation). 

My mind is just blown and I had no idea I was a carrier. No one in my family from either parents had CF. At least none that Ive ever heard of. I didnt even know about CF until about 10 years ago. 

After doing a deep dive on Google (which is awful at anytime, but especially when you are pregnant) I found that 1 in 25 caucasians are a carrier for a CF mutation. My husband is going to get tested to see if he is a carrier and then go from there. I am trying to stay positive, but its been hard.

Hello everyone, 

I've been having long standing LERD from the last 13 years, roughly. I was first diagnosed with GERD, but as my symptoms progressed, it was then changed to LERD. My symptoms have usually been coming on and off and they have been doing so over the last several years. The longest I've been free from symptoms has been 6 months (which was years ago) but the symptoms always come back. 

Early on, when the disease started, it started with a feeling of a lump in my throat that wouldn't go even if I cleared my throat. That feeling persisted for days at time. After my diagnosis I was put on PPIs (Omiprazole) and that didn't really help. But with time, that feeling of a lump in the throat disappeared. This feeling of a lump in the throat kept coming back and disappearing a few times over the years. 

  
However, off late the lumpy feeling has disappeared in favor of chronic cough and throat clearing. I literally start coughing very badly after eating anything and also a few minutes after I wake up in the morning, I have a \~10 min long cough with wheezing. It's bad enough. 

I do have a bit of abdominal pain, but nothing too serious. I've tried a lot of the advice from the internet such as 

* Raising my head while sleeping
* Eating smaller, more frequent meals
* Sleeping on the left side at night
* Apple cider vinegar with water

None of that has helped. My cough is the same. I also am on PPIs (Omiprazole). Again that is not helping. 

There is no trigger food as such that I have been able to identify. I just start coughing after eating/drinking anything, with the exception of water. Most of the cough is wet with a good amount of wheezing in between as the cough gets worse over time. I usually need  to spit out the excess saliva. The symptoms sometimes get better once the saliva gets cleared from the throat, but sometimes not. 

How would you guys advice I approach these symptoms? 

Thanks

Hello everyone.

My son has been on Kaftrio for the last 4 months. His weight is slowly moving up and his FEV is now constantly in the 100-110 area - this is all fantastic, but...

Every 10 days or so he really complains that his nose feels super itchy.  He doesn't have any mucus to blow out and he seems to want to snort to try to make it stop hurting.  I try to get him to blow it, but that doesn't produce anything.

Obviously I'm thinking sinus, but has anyone had this feeling?  Could this be a Kaftrio side-effect?

Seems odd that it comes and goes.  We thought it was due to chlorine in the swimming pool, but he hasn't been swimming for 3 weeks now.

Not looking for diagnosis etc, but I'd like to have a bit of anecdotal before we discuss with his team at his next face-to-face.

Symptoms have subsided for the most part with lansoprazole 30mg, I've now weaned down to 15mg. I'd get acid reflux in the throat, throat tightness, burning, upper abdomen pain, gnawing etc. 

One of the symptoms I still have is throat pain. It sometimes feels tight/irritated and also it feels physically tender to touch and painful at times. I don't believe I get reflux anymore because I no longer experience any burning like I used to, never any sour taste on tongue etc. but my throat just feels inflamed sometimes and my neck physically feels tender/as if it's hurt on the inside almost? But then other times it's completely normal to touch and doesn't feel inflamed at all. Is this normal or does anyone have an explanation for this? This is one of my last symptoms apart from upper abdomen stinging sometimes but infrequently. Also just wanted to add doctor did not advise for me to have an endoscopy at the time because h said he thought it wasn't necessary. Advice would be appreciated thanks."

Basically I've started a new job and subsequently got Trikafta. I was hoping to do things the other way around, but that's not how it worked out. I'm trying to avoid having to take any time off to deal with the infamous ""purge"" if possible.

So I was wondering how long it took from your first dose until you started to feel a little rough around the edges (if at all, for you). I was wondering if I could time the first dose to be late Friday morning, so by the time I might be feeling rough it would be the end of the work day and then I'd have all weekend to deal with symptoms and see how I feel Monday.

Company seems super great, and I'm sure they would give me the time off if needed (they know about my CF, and know I am getting this new miracle drug) , but I literally just started last Monday and don't want to have to make that request. At the same time, I want to be putting my best foot forward while I'm actually on the job so don't want to be purging while I need to be focusing on work.

Hi, today I had a really interesting session with my therapist.

I stopped and thought for a couple of minutes and then I remembered that I had a really bad fight with my girlfriend where she told me a lot of things that hurt me.

As soon as she started to tell me those things I started having flashbacks of a lot of traumas.

When the situation calmed down my girlfriend actually came up to me and had a
Serious talk where she told me that she was sorry,she didnt mean to tell me those things and she never meant to hurt me.

After a couple of hours I started dissociating, I continued having more flashbacks of my trauma.

I was feeling nothing, I went to sleep and the next day I started to having a psychotic break.

But ,he told me there is no particular procedure for  asymmtomatic high ua..it is upto the patient but, he want me to  use ult to bring it down then try to manage it with lifestyle changes..As it is pretty hard to bring ua by lifestyle changes and also howlong ua will be high in the blood it will but oxidative stress to heart ,kidney and changes are high to cause some permanent damage to those organs as blood start to becomes acidic and thick ... So, we need to bring the oxidative stress down as early as possible.

What is your take about it ?"

 Hey guys,

Im a young guy with no work experience whos looking for a job. Ive done one year of college and am currently taking a gap year.

But over the last several months, Ive developed[ Gastroesophageal reflux disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940), which forces me to spend 6+ hours a day eating and drinking.

I tried to research this question online, but despite the fact that many people have GERD, I somehow cant find any good answers.

I believe that, despite this burden, Im capable of working a part-time job and still being able to eat before and after it. But I worry that with a full-time job, I literally wont have the time to get enough Calories and water every day. I plan to snack whenever I can throughout the workday, but Ill probably only be able to find so much time. Also, I think its a bad idea to try to eat while Im working, as distracted eating only makes my GERD symptoms worse.

Should I only apply to full-time jobs if I know they provide a flexible schedule beforehand? Or should I try applying to standard full-time jobs, then mention my condition during the interview/after Im hired to see if the employer can make accommodations? Or should I only apply to part-time jobs until I get my condition under control (who knows how long thatll take)?

I have a lot of doctor baggage from years of feeling awful, but my bloodwork (etc) is always fine and therefore Im always fine. 


Here is a quick summary of what Ive been through


-Started having extreme fatigue. Checked thyroid over and over. Always good along with everything else.


-Had an episode where I nearly fainted. Was bed ridden for weeks. My head felt like it was buzzing. I only felt relief from laying down. I felt spaced out and exhausted. This exhaustion is like nothing I can describe. Its like its too much work to even breathe. When the buzzing subsidedI had a tremor in my hand, ankles, neck, even my voice! Went to a neurologist who told me that my tremor wasnt too bad, and just to come back if it got worse.


-Fast forward a couple years, the tremor very slowly stopped (except on the worst days). One night, I was driving home and suddenly couldnt talk properly. It felt like I had to push the words out of myself with extreme effort. I was sent to the ER where they checked me and ran a stroke protocol. From this, I learned I had white matter on my brain that could be MS or could be from migraines. I was sent to another neurologist, which I couldnt see for months bc of the waitlist (so thankfully I was feeling some better then). He told me from the MRI he didnt think it was MS, and that he could do a lumbar puncture, but since I was feeling better, the results would not be accurate. So I opted out of that, and just kept plugging along. At this time, I also had read about MS and even though I thought anything was possible, MS as I read it, just didnt seem to fit. 


-From then on throughout the last couple years, I often have weird vision disturbances. Bouts of extreme fatigue. If I over do itI have severe left side pain. (Which has been check via ultrasound and CT). Facial numbness on the top half of my face (this is new). I space out. Cant find certain words. Choke easily, even when not eating/drinking. My left pinky also has become curled. Just WEIRD/stressful things.


-So, I went back to my GP and just laid it all out. He says he believes its a real possibility that its MS and here I am being sent to another neurologist (the former one retired).  (I did not mention MSthis is what he said after listening to my symptoms and look at the MRI from the ER visit)


I just want this appointment to give answers, whether its MS or not, you know? I have done this over and over. Please give me the tools I need to have a successful appointment with answers. Im afraid of what the next few year will be like, bc each episode seems to be getting worse and having crazier after effects.

1357,rweh0f,t5_2qlaa,"Reflux Esophagitis?
tldr: wondering if I have reflux esophagitis and if it can be self-treated/how to do so. 

Hi all! I don't have GERD, and I go weeks at a time without reflux. This is a very long post that covers a few days of symptoms, so I apologize in advanced. 

This all started during a New Years party, and a lot of potential triggers or events occured. First, I ate a TON of food. My eyes got itchy and I felt a bit allergic at one point, and soon got a headache. I then took a couple advils for the headache, felt better and ate more,  and then drank alcohol right before bed (Yes, I know that was a bad idea). I could feel the fire in my chest when I was going to sleep, but it didn't hurt too bad when I laid down so I ignored it. 

I woke up New Year's Day, and I knew something was up because I was constantly burping. I could not eat anything without feeling a burning in my esophagus. I was having this reflux-type burning pain, and various other chest pains. I was also nauseous but only when food was in my mouth. The nausea would immediately go away otherwise. No stomach pain of any kind. Burning pain in chest was maybe 7/10. 

By next day, (after having eaten VERY little calories) my appetite was very much gone, and food still made me nauseous. I was still burping a little. I ate only mashed potatoes and some plain pasta, kept everything soft, ate slow, and chewed a lot. Barely felt any burning, and when I did, it was maybe a 2/10. I don't know how it got better so fast, but I am now TERRIFIED to eat because I don't know what the heck caused this awful episode. 

I did some research and landed on 'Reflux esophagitis'?  Esophagitis seemingly has a few types, but I don't think I have the NSAID/pill burning version, or the bacteria-based version. Can you get esophagitis from one evening of ignoring reflux/acid? Is it something else? No stomach pain or nausea during any of this, but my esophagus burning has gone from that 7 down to a 2, so seemingly I'm improving. Is this something that will likely resolve on its own? Any advice or experience is appreciated.","Reflux Esophagitis?

1361,sox88m,t5_2s23e,"Spoilers ahead: I watched last week's episode of ""The Resident"" and I have feelings
So for those of you who watch the TV show The Resident, you likely noticed a lot of what I noticed this past week. I have such mixed feelings about how they portrayed the diagnosis and I just needed to vent them to people who will understand. 


Background: One of the doctors has been having some symptoms in his hand recently and covertly had one of his colleagues run tests. He just found out it is MS. Dr. Bell, the doctor receiving the diagnosis, is an older surgeon. 

On the good side, I appreciated that they accurately represented the emotional fallout from diagnosis that I know I dealt with and see many others in here deal with shortly after finding out. He lashed out a bit and made the rash decision to quit practicing medicine because there's no point any more. He threw himself a pity party that I know all too well and I respect that they did show this. 

On the bad side though? This is a medical drama and his character is a well respected senior level doctor. I feel like the writers had a responsibility to research MS better and give Dr. Bell both experiences and dialog that is medically accurate. The biggest things that stood out to me revolved around his optic neuritis. He had exactly one moment of optic neuritis and it lasted approximately 5 minutes. Now I could be wrong, but does that sound right to any of you guys? Additionally, he stated that because he had that one single event of optic neuritis, that alone was evidence that he had an aggressive case and that was his justification for quitting. 

Now I do agree that someone with active flares, or someone who hasn't recovered from a flare should not be performing surgery. There's no question is unethical to cut if you can't control your fine motor skills or see at that point in time. But that's not the angle he was taking and I was just frankly disappointed.

Has anyone else watched the show? What are your thoughts? Did you have a completely different take on the episode? I've loved this show from the start and now I just don't know what to feel about this new story arc.","Spoilers ahead: I watched last week's episode of ""The Resident"" and I have feelings

Hey all.

So, my clinic are super stumped by some strange issues Ive got going on and have resorted to shoulder-shrugging. Im hoping one of you guys has some insight.

In January I was taken off of Itraconizole. Id had a few runs of fungal plugs, but my Aspergillus ige was too low to justify my staying on it.

Immediately after finishing it my health drop off. My lungs feel moderately clear (been on Ivacaftor since 2013), but some tightness and increased sputum. The main symptom was dizziness, weakness, and general feeling of malaise. Id become dizzy when I stood up and would sometimes find myself having to grip walls or doors when feeling like I might lose consciousness (never did fully, but fell into a few walls). I started Trikafta/Kaftrio during this period, but it didnt help.

A few weeks ago I did a fortnight stint in the ward on Meropenem & Tobramycin, with Aminophylline overnight. No change whatsoever until my last dose of Meropenem when I felt a strange burning sensation just over my upper abdomen on the right (near bottom of rib cage). It lasted a couple of minutes then went away. Shortly after I had a burning pain in my right shoulder which stuck around for like 3-4 hours. ECG and BP fine.

Shoulder pain was quite bad. It came and went over the next week, then on day 8 it came back big! 7/10 pain for hours. Prior to this I was still experiencing the malaise, then the day after this bad pain my dizziness disappeared completely. One thing to add, after the bouts of pain my urine had a strange sickly sweet smell.

Hey all.

So, my clinic are super stumped by some strange issues Ive got going on and have resorted to shoulder-shrugging. Im hoping one of you guys has some insight.

In January I was taken off of Itraconizole. Id had a few runs of fungal plugs, but my Aspergillus ige was too low to justify my staying on it.

Immediately after finishing it my health drop off. My lungs feel moderately clear (been on Ivacaftor since 2013), but some tightness and increased sputum. The main symptom was dizziness, weakness, and general feeling of malaise. Id become dizzy when I stood up and would sometimes find myself having to grip walls or doors when feeling like I might lose consciousness (never did fully, but fell into a few walls). I started Trikafta/Kaftrio during this period, but it didnt help.

A few weeks ago I did a fortnight stint in the ward on Meropenem & Tobramycin, with Aminophylline overnight. No change whatsoever until my last dose of Meropenem when I felt a strange burning sensation just over my upper abdomen on the right (near bottom of rib cage). It lasted a couple of minutes then went away. Shortly after I had a burning pain in my right shoulder which stuck around for like 3-4 hours. ECG and BP fine.

Shoulder pain was quite bad. It came and went over the next week, then on day 8 it came back big! 7/10 pain for hours. Prior to this I was still experiencing the malaise, then the day after this bad pain my dizziness disappeared completely. One thing to add, after the bouts of pain my urine had a strange sickly sweet smell.

My Drs have no clue whatsoever as to what happened. Ive been under investigation for heart issues and had CTs and a Echocardiogram, but nothing came back. My heart rate is higher than its ever been (resting gone to mid-60s from late-50s for last few months (Fitbit)), but they dont seem concerned. Bloods dont show anything irregular. Theyre disregarding the upper abdomen pain as a red-herring, but thats seems strange to me as theyre clearly linked.

My wife has epilepsy and we have a newborn baby. 
She was told by her neurologist to get at least 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep every night. I'm staying up with our 4 week old son to make sure she gets this. 
She's concerned that this sleep will screw up her breastfeeding schedule and she won't produce as much milk as she can be. She feeds directly and pumps when she can during the day so I have breastmilk to feed our son overnight. In order to get 4 hours of sleep she goes to bed and sets an alarm for 5 hours  from when she gets in bed as she never falls asleep right away. 
She has a lactation consultant but she doesn't have any advice specific for someone with epilepsy and her neurologist doesn't have much advice about breastfeeding.

1377,st01vz,t5_2syer,"My experience with Allupurinol (am I the odd one out...?)
so I was having pretty frequent attacks. Definitely a combination of genetics, lack of exercise and poor diet.

But then I stopped all of that and was still extremely sensitive to attacks e.g. I could eat one rich meal, and be in pain in the same night.

Went to the doctor and said I can take allopurinol and so I did for about 2-3 months. During the course the attacks pretty much were almost as frequent (which apparently is to be expected) but they continued well into the second month. I tried my best to exercise as much as I could during this period - averaged at least 2 swims a week and later jogged 1-2 times a week.

and now that the course is over I seem to be cured. I've not had an attack since I stopped taking Allo, which was around mid-December. but also I've been mostly good with diet, avoiding high protein / meat-heavy meals. I've not kept up with the exercises as much.

so I'm just surprised that the attacks stopped soon as I stopped taking allo that's all, and wanted to see if others have similar experience.","My experience with Allupurinol (am I the odd one out...?)

I started a new job about 2 months ago. At the time I not only didnt feel the need to tell them about my epilepsy, but I generally dont really like talking about it to most people.

This is understandable to me however I hadnt had any seizure activity in about 6 months prior to this (I was waiting to get it under control with new meds to look for a new job). 

Today was the first focal aware seizure Ive had in awhile (I havent had a grand mal in about a year). For obvious reasons, I was terrified, but also because no one at my job knows about my epilepsy, not even my boss. I just kind of got up and walked out. I wanted to get home before things got worse and before I possibly had more and was unable to drive myself home (yes, dont even come for me I drove myself home).

Now, I dont know what to do going forward. When I got home I texted my boss and told her I had a personal emergency and I was sorry I left without giving her a warning. I think I look like a freak and an even bigger one if I have to explain myself about the epilepsy. 

Side note- my boss and I work in separate locations, everything we do is done via email, call, text, etc. Im kind of like a virtual assistant except I work out of a large office with other assistants, reporting to people we dont share a building with. I just cant imagine how awkward that phone call would be to explain to her that I hid my epilepsy for the last two months or why I did it.

I've been taking PPI's (once a day) for around 2 years OTC like an idiot and stopped now after the Dr said I need to stop gluten and that's helped my reflux almost go away just in a couple weeks.

Much appreciated.

Hi everyone,

35M, diagnosed today (only confirmed what I already knew).   


So I have an appointment with my neuro coming up soon, to discuss medication. As i understand it, right off the bat I will have two choices: Rituximab and Mavenclad.  
I'm looking for experiences and recommendations here. Been trying to read up on both, and they both seem promising, even thought they are somewhat different.

For the Rituximab I have to participate in a study, with followups, forms and whatnot (and i hate needles, but if I have to, I'll still do it). The Mavenclad I can get prescribed the same day and start right away.

A little bit about my progression; I've only had symptoms since the previous summer, with double vision for a couple of weeks and some numbness/weakness in my leg (one weak, one numb) which passed. Now I can hardly notice, except maybe a sort of depressive/lethargic state (which may or may not be linked to MS) 

(On a side note, i like smoking weed from time to time, and it's something I really enjoy, and a nice reward for myself. Will any of these be a showstopper?)

Not saying the booster was related to my seizure but before I go on, a little back story. I was on 3000 mg of keppra a day for almost 10 years. I had my first seizure in Nov. 2010. I realized that I thought my  dosage may be too high because around June 2021, I would be so tired after taking keppra. The doctor lowered my dosage to 1000 mg a day then and there. I was fine all the way until Nov  2021. I honestly will admit that I did intermittingly forget to take my pills (here and there take in morning and forget in evening vice/versa) and about 30 minutes after I fell asleep, I had a seizure.

In Dec 2021, I had another seizure about 30 minutes after I fell asleep and this time I was on my medication without issue. The only thing different was that I had my flu and covid booster 8 hours earlier. Do you think there is a link? My doctor said there could be but is not sure. I want to go back to 3000 mg a day but he only upped my meds by 250 so now I am on 1250 mg a day. I am so afraid of having another seizure. I have never had a seizure during the day only at night. As of now, my Dr has not called me back again wanting to go back to 3000 mg a day. I am seeking a second opinion.","Seizure After Booster
Not saying the booster was related to my seizure but before I go on, a little back story. I was on 3000 mg of keppra a day for almost 10 years. I had my first seizure in Nov. 2010. I realized that I thought my  dosage may be too high because around June 2021, I would be so tired after taking keppra. The doctor lowered my dosage to 1000 mg a day then and there.

1423,rntijr,t5_2qlaa,"Why does chewing my food slowly get rid of gerd but I still have burping and a slight feeling of indigestion?
Someone told me that digestion starts in the mouth and I needed to chew my food until it turned into a liquid until swallowing it, I was a bit hesitant because I like eating food really fast.

So I tried it and.. It worked?
I literally have no heartburn or acid reflux, I still have bloating and burping that comes up every now and then, and very rarley there's a slight vomit feeling coming up but then it somehow gets blocked and I can't vomit, it's like a reflux fail basically. I'm annoyed I have to eat food so slow because I get less enjoyment from it, but if it works it works.

Now I tell myself this line all the time ""If you ain't gonna chew, don't eat the food' and I keep that playing in my head so I don't ever eat quickly again, because as soon as I do I get all my symptoms again.","Why does chewing my food slowly get rid of gerd but I still have burping and a slight feeling of indigestion?
